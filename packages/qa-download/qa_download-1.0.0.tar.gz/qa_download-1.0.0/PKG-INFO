# Music Downloader ðŸŽ¶

**Music Downloader** is a Python tool that downloads music from YouTube and automatically embeds metadata, album artwork, and lyrics from Genius. Perfect for building your offline music library with well-organized tags and rich media.

## Features

- **Downloads audio** from YouTube as MP3
- **Embeds metadata** like title, artist, album, and release date
- **Fetches album artwork** and attaches it to the MP3
- **Adds lyrics** automatically from Genius
- Works with most Python environments and media players

## Installation

You can install Music Downloader directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install music_downloader
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- YouTube audio extraction and metadata libraries (automatically installed with the package)

## Usage

Once installed, use `music-downloader` directly from the command line:

```bash
music-downloader "Song Title"
```

By default, files are saved in your Music directory, but you can specify a custom directory with the `--output_dir` option:

```bash
music-downloader "Song Title" --output_dir "/path/to/save/music"
```

### Example

music-downloader "Let Me Down Slowly Alec Benjamin"
```

This will:
1. Search YouTube for the official video of **"Let Me Down Slowly" by Alec Benjamin**.
2. Download the audio as an MP3.
3. Fetch metadata, album artwork, and lyrics from Genius.
4. Embed all metadata and save the file.

### Command-Line Options

- `song_name`: The title of the song you want to download.
