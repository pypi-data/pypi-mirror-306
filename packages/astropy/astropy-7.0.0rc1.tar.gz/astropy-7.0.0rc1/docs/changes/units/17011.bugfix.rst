The unit parsers are now better at recognizing unusual composite
units:

- units involving special unicode symbols, like "L☉/pc²";
- units that include CDS units ending in a 0, like "eps0/s";
- units including the degree symbol, "°". For example, "°C/s" is no
  longer incorrectly interpreted as "°C/s^2".
