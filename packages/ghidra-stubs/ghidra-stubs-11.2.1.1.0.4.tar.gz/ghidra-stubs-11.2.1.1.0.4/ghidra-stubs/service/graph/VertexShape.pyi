         will need to override this value to some value &gt; 1 to fit the label in the shape. For 
         example, a rectangle shape does not need to be extended because text naturally fits. But
         for a shape like a triangle, its bounding box needs to be bigger so that text doesn't
         "stick out" in the narrow part of the triangle.
