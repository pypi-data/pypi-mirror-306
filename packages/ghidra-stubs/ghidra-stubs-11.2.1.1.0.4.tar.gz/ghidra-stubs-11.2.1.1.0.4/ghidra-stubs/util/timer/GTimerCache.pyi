class GTimerCache(object):
    """
    Class for caching key,value entries for a limited time and cache size. Entries in this cache
     will be removed after the cache duration time has passed. If the cache ever exceeds its capacity,
     the least recently used entry will be removed.
 
     This class uses a LinkedHashMap with it ordering mode set to "access order". This means
     that iterating through keys, values, or entries of the map will be presented oldest first. 
     Inserting or accessing an entry in the map will move the entry to the back of the list, thus
     making it the youngest. This means that entries closest to or past expiration will be presented
     first. 
 
     This class is designed to be subclassed for two specific cases. The first case is for when 
     additional processing is required when an entry is removed from the cache. This typically would
     be for cases where resources need to be released, such as closing a File or disposing the object.
     The second reason to subclass this cache is to get more control of expiring values. Overriding
     #shouldRemoveFromCache(Object, Object), which gets called when an entry's time
     has expired, gives the client a chance to decide if the entry should be removed.
