    A pseudo-terminal
 
 
     A pseudo-terminal is essentially a two way pipe where one end acts as the parent, and the other
     acts as the child. The process opening the pseudo-terminal is given a handle to both ends. The
     child end is generally given to a subprocess, possibly designating the pty as the controlling tty
     of a new session. This scheme is how, for example, an SSH daemon starts a new login shell. The
     shell is given the child end, and the parent end is presented to the SSH client.
 
 
     This is more powerful than controlling a process via standard in and standard out. 1) Some
     programs detect whether or not stdin/out/err refer to the controlling tty. For example, a program
     should avoid prompting for passwords unless stdin is the controlling tty. Using a pty can provide
     a controlling tty that is not necessarily controlled by a user. 2) Terminals have other
     properties and can, e.g., send signals to the foreground process group (job) by sending special
     characters. Normal characters are passed to the child, but special characters may be interpreted
     by the terminal's line discipline. A rather common case is to send Ctrl-C (character
     003). Using stdin, the subprocess simply reads 003. With a properly-configured pty and session,
     the subprocess is interrupted (sent SIGINT) instead.
 
 
     This class opens a pseudo-terminal and presents both ends as individual handles. The parent end
     simply provides an input and output stream. These are typical byte-oriented streams, except that
     the data passes through the pty, subject to interpretation by the OS kernel. On Linux, this means
     the pty will apply the configured line discipline. Consult the host OS documentation for special
     character sequences.
 
 
     The child end also provides the input and output streams, but it is uncommon to use them from the
     same process. More likely, subprocess is launched in a new session, configuring the child as the
     controlling terminal. Thus, the child handle provides methods for obtaining the child pty file
     name and/or spawning a new session. Once spawned, the parent end is used to control the session.
 
 
     Example:
 
 
     Pty pty = factory.openpty();
     pty.getChild().session("bash");
 
     PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(pty.getParent().getOutputStream());
     writer.println("echo test");
     BufferedReader reader =
     	new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(pty.getParent().getInputStream()));
     System.out.println(reader.readLine());
     System.out.println(reader.readLine());
 
     pty.close();

        Closes both ends of the pty
 
         <p>
         This only closes this process's handles to the pty. For the parent end, this should be the
         only process with a handle. The child end may be opened by any number of other processes.
         More than likely, however, those processes will terminate once the parent end is closed,
         since reads or writes on the child will produce EOF or an error.
