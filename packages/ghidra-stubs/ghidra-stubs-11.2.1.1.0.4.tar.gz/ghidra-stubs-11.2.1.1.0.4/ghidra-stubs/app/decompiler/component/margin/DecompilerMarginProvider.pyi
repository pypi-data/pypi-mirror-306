         <p>
         The implementation should keep a reference at least to the {@code model} and the
         {@code pixmap} for later use during painting. The model provides access to the lines of
         decompiler C code. Each layout corresponds to a single line of C code. For example, the first
         line of code is rendered by the layout at index 0. The tenth is rendered by the layout at
         index 9. Rarely, a line may be wrapped by the renderer, leading to a non-uniform layout. The
         {@code pixmap} can map from a pixel's vertical position to the layout index at the same
         position in the main panel. It accounts for scrolling an non-uniformity. It is safe to assume
         the layouts render contiguous lines of C code. The recommended strategy for painting is thus:
 
         <ol>
         <li>Compute the visible part of the margin needing repainting. See
         {@link JComponent#getVisibleRect()}</li>
         <li>Compute the layout indices for the vertical bounds of that part. See
         {@link LayoutPixelIndexMap#getIndex(int)}</li>
         <li>Iterate over the layouts within those bounds, inclusively.</li>
         <li>Compute the vertical position of each layout and paint something appropriate for its
         corresponding line. See {@link LayoutPixelIndexMap#getPixel(BigInteger)}</li>
         </ol>
