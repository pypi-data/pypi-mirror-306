class AddressRangeMapDB(object, db.DBListener):
    """
    AddressRangeMapDB provides a generic value range map backed by a database table.
     Values can be stored for ranges of addresses. When a value is stored for a range, it replaces
     any previous values for that range. It is kind of like painting. If you first paint a region
     red, but then later paint a region in the middle of the red region green, you end up with
     three regions - a green region surrounded by two red regions.
 
     This is implemented by storing records for each contiguous range with the same value.
 
     		The key is the encoded start address of the range.
     		The TO_COL column of the record stores the encoded end address of the range.
     		The VALUE_COL column of the record stores the value for the range.
 
 
     This implementation is complicated by several issues. 
 
     	   Addresses stored in Ghidra database records are encoded as long keys (see 
     		  AddressMap). 
     		  Encoded addresses do not necessarily encode to keys that have the same ordering. 
     	      Therefore, all comparisons must be done in address space and not in the encoded space.
     		  Also, record iterators must use the AddressKeyRecordIterator which will return
     		  records in address order versus encoded key order.
         The default space's image base can be changed after records have been created. This can
            cause the address ranges represented by a record to wrap around. For example, suppose
            the image base is 0 and you paint a range from address 0 to 0x20, which say maps to
            keys 0 and 20, respectively. Now suppose the image base changes to 0xfffffffe, which 
            means key 0 maps to address 0xfffffffe and key 0x20 maps to address 0x1e,(the addresses
            have been effectively shifted down by 2). So now the stored record has a start key of
            0 and an end key of 0x20 which now maps to start address of 0xfffffffe and an end 
            address of 0x1e. For our purposes, it is important that we don't just flip the start
            and end address which be a very large range instead of a small range. Instead, we need 
            to interpret that as 2 ranges (0xfffffffe - 0xffffffff) and (0 - 0x1e). So all methods
            in this class have be coded to handle this special case. To simplify the painting
            logic, any wrapping record will first be split into two records before painting. However
            we can only do this during a write operation (when we can make changes). Since the getter
            methods and iterators cannot modify the database, they have to deal with wrapping
            records on the fly.
