    Logic for reading LEB128 values.
 
     LEB128 is a variable length integer encoding that uses 7 bits per byte, with the high bit
     being reserved as a continuation flag, with the least significant bytes coming first 
     (Little Endian Base 128).
 
     This implementation only supports reading values that decode to at most 64 bits (to fit into
     a java long).
 
     When reading a value, you must already know if it was written as a signed or unsigned value to
     be able to decode it correctly.
