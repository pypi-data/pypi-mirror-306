class Encoder(object):
    """
    An interface for writing structured data to a stream

     The resulting encoded data is structured similarly to an XML document. The document contains a nested set
     of \elements, with labels corresponding to the ElementId class. A single element can hold
     zero or more attributes and zero or more child elements.  An attribute holds a primitive
     data element (boolean, long, String) and is labeled by an AttributeId. The document is written
     using a sequence of openElement() and closeElement() calls, intermixed with write*() calls to encode
     the data primitives.  All primitives written using a write*() call are associated with current open element,
     and all write*() calls for one element must come before opening any child element.
     The traditional XML element text content can be written using the special ATTRIB_CONTENT AttributeId, which
     must be the last write*() call associated with the specific element.
