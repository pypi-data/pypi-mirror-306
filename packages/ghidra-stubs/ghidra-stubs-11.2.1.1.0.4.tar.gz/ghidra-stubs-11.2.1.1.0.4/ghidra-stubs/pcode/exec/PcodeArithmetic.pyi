    An interface that defines arithmetic p-code operations on values of type .

 
     See BytesPcodeArithmetic for the typical pattern when implementing an arithmetic. There
     are generally two cases: 1) Where endianness matters, 2) Where endianness does not matter. The
     first is typical. The implementation should be an Enum with two constants, one for the
     big endian implementation, and one for the little endian implementation. The class should also
     provide static methods:  for getting the correct one based
     on endianness, and  for getting the correct one given a
     language. If endianness does not matter, then the implementation should follow a singleton
     pattern. See notes on #getEndian() for the endian-agnostic case.
