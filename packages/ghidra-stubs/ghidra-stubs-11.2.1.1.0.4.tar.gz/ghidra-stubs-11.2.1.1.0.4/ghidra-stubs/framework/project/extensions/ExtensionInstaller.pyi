    Utility class for managing Ghidra Extensions.
 
     Extensions are defined as any archive or folder that contains an extension.properties
     file. This properties file can contain the following attributes:
 
     name (required)
     description
     author
     createdOn (format: MM/dd/yyyy)
     version
 

 
     Extensions may be installed/uninstalled by users at runtime, using the
     ExtensionTableProvider. Installation consists of unzipping the extension archive to an
     installation folder, currently {ghidra user settings dir}/Extensions. To uninstall,
     the unpacked folder is simply removed.
