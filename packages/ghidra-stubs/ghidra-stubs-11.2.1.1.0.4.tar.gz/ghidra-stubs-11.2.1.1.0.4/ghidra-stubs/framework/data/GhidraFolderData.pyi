class GhidraFolderData(object):
    """
    GhidraFolderData provides the managed object which represents a project folder that 
     corresponds to matched folder paths across both a versioned and private 
     filesystem and viewed as a single folder at the project level.  This class closely mirrors the
     DomainFolder interface and is used by the GhidraFolder implementation; both of which
     represent immutable folder references.  Changes made to this folder's name or path are not reflected 
     in old DomainFolder instances and must be re-instantiated following such a change.  
     Any long-term retention of DomainFolder and DomainFile instances requires an 
     appropriate change listener to properly discard/reacquire such instances.
