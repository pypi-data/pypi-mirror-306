class SemisparseByteArray(object):
    """
    A sparse byte array characterized by contiguous dense regions
 
 
     Notionally, the array is 2 to the power 64 bytes in size. Only the initialized values are
     actually stored. Uninitialized indices are assumed to have the value 0. Naturally, this
     implementation works best when the array is largely uninitialized. For efficient use, isolated
     initialized values should be avoided. Rather, an entire range should be initialized at the same
     time.
 
 
     On a number line, the initialized indices of a semisparse array might be depicted:
 
 
     -----   --------- - ------         ---
 
 
 
     In contrast, the same for a sparse array might be depicted:
 
 
     -    --  -  - -    ---     --     -         -
 
 
 
     This implementation is well-suited for memory caches where the memory is accessed by reading
     ranges instead of individual bytes. Because consecutive reads and writes tend to occur in a
     common locality, caches using a semisparse array may perform well.
 
 
     This implementation is also thread-safe. Any thread needing exclusive access for multiple reads
     and/or writes, e.g., to implement a compare-and-set operation, must apply additional
     synchronization.
