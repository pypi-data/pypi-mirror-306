    Interface for objects that display (or consume) graphs.  Normally, a graph display represents
     a visual component for displaying and interacting with a graph.  Some implementation may not
     be a visual component, but instead consumes/processes the graph (i.e. graph exporter). In this
     case, there is no interactive element and once the graph has been set on the display, it is
