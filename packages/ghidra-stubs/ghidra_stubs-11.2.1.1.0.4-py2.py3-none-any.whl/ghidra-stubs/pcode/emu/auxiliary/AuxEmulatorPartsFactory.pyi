class AuxEmulatorPartsFactory(object):
    """
    An auxiliary emulator parts factory for stand-alone emulation

 
     This can manufacture all the parts needed for a stand-alone emulator with concrete and some
     implementation-defined auxiliary state. More capable emulators may also use many of these parts.
     Usually, the additional capabilities deal with how state is loaded and stored or otherwise made
     available to the user. The pattern of use for a stand-alone emulator is usually in a script:
     Create an emulator, initialize its state, write instructions to its memory, create and initialize
     a thread, point its counter at the instructions, instrument, step/run, inspect, and finally
     terminate.
 
 
     This "parts factory" pattern aims to flatten the extension points of the
     AbstractPcodeMachine and its components into a single class. Its use is not required, but
     may make things easier. It also encapsulates some "special knowledge," that might not otherwise
     be obvious to a developer, e.g., it creates the concrete state pieces, so the developer need not
     guess (or keep up to date) the concrete state piece classes to instantiate.
 
 
     The factory itself should be a singleton object. See the Taint Analyzer for a complete example
     solution using this interface.
