        Add an access breakpoint over the given range
 
         <p>
         Access breakpoints are implemented out of band, without modification to the emulated image.
         The breakpoints are only effective for p-code {@link PcodeOp#LOAD} and {@link PcodeOp#STORE}
         operations with concrete offsets. Thus, an operation that refers directly to a memory
         address, e.g., a memory-mapped register, will not be trapped. Similarly, access breakpoints
         on registers or unique variables will not work. Access to an abstract offset that cannot be
         made concrete, i.e., via {@link PcodeArithmetic#toConcrete(Object, Purpose)} cannot be
         trapped. To interrupt on direct and/or abstract accesses, consider wrapping the relevant
         state and/or overriding {@link PcodeExecutorStatePiece#getVar(Varnode, Reason)} and related.
         For accesses to abstract offsets, consider overriding
         {@link AbstractPcodeMachine#checkLoad(AddressSpace, Object, int)} and/or
         {@link AbstractPcodeMachine#checkStore(AddressSpace, Object, int)} instead.

         indication is given as to which breakpoint interrupted emulation.
