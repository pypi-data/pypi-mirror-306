    """
    This singleton class seeks solutions to PatternExpressions
 
 
     It is rather naive. It does not perform algebraic transformations. Instead, it attempts to fold
     constants, assuming there is a single variable in the expression, modifying the goal as it
     descends toward that variable. If it finds a variable, i.e., token or context field, it encodes
     the solution, positioned in the field. If the expression is constant, it checks that the goal
     agrees. If not, an error is returned. There are some common cases where it is forced to solve
     expressions involving multiple variables. Those cases are addressed in the derivatives of
     AbstractBinaryExpressionSolver where the situation can be detected. One common example is
     field concatenation using the  pattern.
 
 
     TODO: Perhaps this whole mechanism ought to just be factored directly into
     PatternExpression.

         From a simplified perspective, we need only the expression and the desired value to solve it.
         Generally speaking, the expression may only contain a single field, and the encoded result
         specifies the bits of the solved field. It must be absorbed into the overall assembly

         inst_start} must be provided to the solver by the assembler. {@code inst_next} cannot be
