    A convenience for accumulating bytes output by an Assembler
 
 
     This is most useful when there is not a Program available for assembly. If a program is
     available, consider using Assembler#assemble(Address, String...) and reading the bytes
     from the program. If not, or the program should not be modified, then the pattern of use is
     generally:
 
 
     Address start = space.getAdddress(0x00400000);
     Assembler asm = Assemblers.getAssembler(...);
     AssemblyBuffer buffer = new AssemblyBuffer(asm, start);

         <p>
         This will not grow the buffer, so the instruction being patched must already exist in the
         buffer. The typical use case is to fix up a reference:
 
         <pre>
         AssemblyBuffer buf = new AssemblyBuffer(asm, entry);
         // ...
         Address jumpCheck = buf.getNext();

         Address labelCheck = buf.getNext();

         buf.assemble("CMP ECX, 0");
         // ...
         </pre>
 
         <p>
         This does not check that the patched instruction matches length with the new instruction. In
         fact, the buffer does not remember instruction boundaries at all. If verification is needed,
         the caller should check the lengths of the returned byte arrays for the template and the
         patch.
