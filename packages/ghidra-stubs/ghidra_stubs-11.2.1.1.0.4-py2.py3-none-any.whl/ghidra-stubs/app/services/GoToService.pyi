    The GoToService provides a general service for plugins to generate GoTo
     events.  The provider of this service will take care of interfacing with
     any history service that may be available.
 
     This class will execute all  calls on the Java Swing thread.   This will happen in
     a blocking manner if the client calls from any other thread.  This has the potential to lead
     to deadlocks if the client is using custom synchronization.  Care must be taken to not be
     holding any lock that will cause the Swing thread to block when using this class from any other
     thread.   To work around this issue, clients can always call this service from within a
     Swing#runLater(Runnable) call, which will prevent any deadlock issues.
