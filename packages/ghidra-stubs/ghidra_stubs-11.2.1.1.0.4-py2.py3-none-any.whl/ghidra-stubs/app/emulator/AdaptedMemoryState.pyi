class AdaptedMemoryState(ghidra.pcode.memstate.AbstractMemoryState):
    """
    An implementation of MemoryState which wraps a newer PcodeExecutorState.
 
 
     This is a transitional component used internally by the AdaptedEmulator. It is also used
     in the ModifiedPcodeThread, which is part of the newer PcodeEmulator system, as a
     means of incorporating EmulateInstructionStateModifier, which is part of the older
     EmulatorHelper system. This class will be removed once both conditions are met:
 
 
     An equivalent state modification system is developed for the PcodeEmulator system,
     and each EmulateInstructionStateModifier is ported to it.
     The AdaptedEmulator class is removed.
 
 
 
     Guidance for the use of this class is the same as AdaptedEmulator.
