    Class for storing a weak reference to object instances. Objects of type T can be placed in this 
     store and they will remain there until there are no references to that object. Note 
     that this is not a Set and you can have multiple instances that are "equal" in this store.The 
     main purpose of this store is to be able to get all objects in the store that are still 
     referenced.  This is useful when you need to visit all in use items.   
 
     This class is thread safe.
