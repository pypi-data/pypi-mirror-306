class ThreadSafeListenerStorage(object):
    """
    A very specific data structure that provides 'copy on write' behavior while the client is
     iterating the elements.
 
     This class is meant for a very narrow and specific use case that includes: having a relatively
     small number of listeners and the need for only basic adding, removing and iterating.
 
     This class will create a new copy of its internal storage for any write operation, but only if
     that happens while the elements in this class are being iterated.  This avoids unnecessary
     copying.
