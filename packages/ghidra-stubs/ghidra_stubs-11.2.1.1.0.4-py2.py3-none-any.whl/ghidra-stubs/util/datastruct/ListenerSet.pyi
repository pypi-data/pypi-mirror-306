class ListenerSet(object):
    """
    A data structure meant to be used to hold listeners.  This class has a few benefits:
 
      Clients supply the class of the listeners being stored.  Then, clients make use of a Java
          Proxy object to sends events by calling the desired method directly on the proxy.
  
      This class is thread safe, allowing adding and removing listeners while events are being
          fired.
  
      Weak or strong references may be used seamlessly by passing the correct constructor value.
  
 

 
     Some restrictions:
 
      Exception handling is currently done by storing the first exception encountered while
          processing events.   Any exception encountered while notifying a listener does not stop
          follow-on listeners from getting notified.
  
      Listener classes are restricted to using methods with a void return type, as there is
          currently no way to return values back to the client when notifying.
  
      The insertion order of listeners is not maintained, which means that event notification may
          take place in an arbitrary order.
  
 

 
     An example use of this class to fire events could look like this:
 
         ListenerSetActionListener listeners = new ListenerSet(ActionListener.class);
         ActionEvent event = new ActionEvent(this, 1, "Event");
         listeners.invoke().actionPerformed(event);

                clients must keep a reference to the listener or it will eventually be removed from
