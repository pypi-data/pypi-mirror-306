    """
    Value class for Program files. The editor component consists of the JTextField 
     and a browse button for bringing up a DataTreeDialog for picking programs from the 
     current project. This class also provides a convenience method for opening a program.
 
     This class and other subclasses of AbstractValue are part of a subsystem for easily
     defining a set of values that can be displayed in an input dialog (ValuesMapDialog).
     Typically, these values are created indirectly using a GValuesMap which is then
     given to the constructor of the dialog. However, an alternate approach is to create the
     dialog without a ValuesMap and then use its ValuesMapDialog#addValue(AbstractValue) 
     method directly.
