Hello hello!

This theme is named after the Greek god `Coeus`_, symbolizing intellect,
knowledge, and inquisitive inquiry. In Greek mythology, Coeus is one of the
Titans, embody the spirit of intelligence, foresight, and rationality-
qualities that resonate deeply with the purpose of this theme. Naming this
theme after Coeus is more than a nod to mythology; it represents a deeper
connection to the essence of documentation itself. Just as Coeus was the
pillar of intellect among the Titans, the Coeus Sphinx Theme is designed to be
the foundation of intelligent and insightful documentation. It aims to enhance
the way information is conveyed, ensuring that the knowledge shared through
your documentation is as clear and impactful as possible.

The Coeus Sphinx Theme is designed for documentation that requires not only
clarity and structure but also a touch of wisdom and elegance. Whether you're
working on a personal project or a complex scientific endeavor, this theme
offers a visually appealing and intellectually stimulating environment to
present your work. The theme's design reflects the importance of foresight,
rationality, and clarityâ€”traits associated with Coeus.

.. note::

    The theme is still in the early stages of development. More updates and
    features will be added soon.
