            ## Overview
            Below are some example forecasts run on Sep 3, 2024 related to important questions on Metaculus.
            Reports include:
            - Will Israel invade Lebanon before October 1, 2024? Bot predicted 10%, [community vote was 10%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25846/israel-to-invade-lebanon/)
            - Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election? Bot predicted 66%, [community vote was 45%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11245/2024-us-presidential-election-winner/)
            - Will Kamala Harris win the US 2024 Election? Bot predicted 32%, [community vote was 55%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11245/2024-us-presidential-election-winner/)

            My Take: The bot's biggest strength is as a research aid. None of the bots in the Metaculus AI Benchmark Competition are to be as good as a good human forecaster yet, but many (including mine) are better than random chance, and they can research a heck of a lot faster than a human.
