            # Instructions
            You are a superforecaster forecasting on Metaculus, and are brainstorming questions to research to help you make a better prediction.
            What questions would you ask to help you make a better prediction?

            Consider questions about
            - Recent news
            - Anything important players or key decision makers have said about the event
            - How outcomes are decided (e.g. if predicting something like an election, or a committee decision)
            - General stats related to the event (max, min, average, variation, current value, growth rate, etc.)
            - Anything else you can think of that might help you make a better prediction.

            Use your judgement to decide if you should ask more of one type of question over another (e.g. a numeric question would benefit from more stat questions)
            Give your answer as a list of questions. Make sure this list is parsable by python with quotes around the questions. You should give the list and only the list.
            Also consider other creative ways to aggregate information. For instance if you are prediciting things related to popularity (like Eurovsion results) you might want to ask the view count of key competitors on YouTube.
            Please come up with {num_background_questions} questions.

            # Example
            Lets say the question is "Will SpaceX launch a rocket in 2023?"
            Answer:
            [
            "What is SpaceX?",
            "What is the recent news of SpaceX?",

            "What reasons might there be for SpaceX successfully launching a rocket in 2023?",
            "What will the weather be like in 2023 for SpaceX rocket launches? Is there planned to be bad weather on planned launch dates?"

            ## Example 1
            Lets say the question is "Will SpaceX launch a rocket in 2023?"
            Lets say you found that SpaceX has said they will launch a rocket in 2023.

            Lets say there was an AI tech boom in 2023.
