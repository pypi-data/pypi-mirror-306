# ðŸš§ GitHub Actions CDK

**github-actions-cdk** is a TypeScript library that simplifies the creation and management of GitHub Actions workflows using Constructs. With this library, developers can define workflows in a structured and type-safe manner, making it easier to automate CI/CD pipelines on GitHub. It also includes Python bindings for developers who prefer working in Python.

## Features

* **Type-Safe Workflows**: Leverage TypeScript's strong typing to define your GitHub Actions workflows and ensure correctness.
* **Python Bindings**: Access the same powerful constructs and features in Python, allowing seamless integration for Python developers.
* **Modular Design**: Easily create and manage jobs, triggers, and options for your workflows.

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage (TypeScript)

Here's a simple example of how to create a GitHub Actions workflow using `github-actions-cdk` in TypeScript::

```python
import { PermissionLevel, Project, actions } from 'github-actions-cdk';

const project = new Project({
  //additionalChecks: true,
});

const workflow = project.addWorkflow("build", {
  name: "Build",
  triggers: {
    push: { branches: ["main"] },
    workflowDispatch: {},
  },
  permissions: {
    contents: PermissionLevel.READ,
  },
});

const job = workflow.addJob("build", {
  env: {
    CI: "true",
  },
});

new actions.CheckoutV4(job, "checkout", {
  name: "Checkout Code",
});

const setupNode = new actions.SetupNodeV4(job, "setup-node", {
  name: "Set up Node.js",
  nodeVersion: "20.x",
});

job.addOutput("node-version", setupNode.outputs.nodeVersion);

project.synth();
```

### Basic Usage (Python)

Here's how to create a GitHub Actions workflow using `github-actions-cdk` in Python:

```python
from github_actions_cdk import Project, PermissionLevel
from github_actions_cdk.actions import CheckoutV4, SetupNodeV4

project = Project(
    #additional_checks=True,
)

workflow = project.add_workflow(
    id="build",
    name="Build",
    triggers={
        "push": {
            "branches": ["main"],
        }
    },
    permissions={
        "contents": PermissionLevel.READ,
    }
)

job = workflow.add_job(
    id="build",
    env={
        "CI": "true",
    },
)

CheckoutV4(
    scope=job,
    id="checkout",
    name="Checkout Code",
)

setup_node = SetupNodeV4(
    scope=job,
    id="setup-node",
    name="Set up Node.js",
    node_version="14.x",
)

job.add_output("node-version", setup_node.outputs.node_version)

project.synth()
```
