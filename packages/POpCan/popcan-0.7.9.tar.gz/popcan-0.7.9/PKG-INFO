# POpCan

Several genes, including pseudogenes often exhibit spatiotemporal expression specificity making them potentially valuable biomarkers. The current tool explores and quantifies the absence (indirectly exploring the presence) of such spatiotemporal expression specificity across multiple categories (up to 3) of cancer, including cancer type (CT), stage (ST) and deregulation type (DT). The analysis based on all 3 categories can include the sub-categories within and between the cancer types or it can be restricted to the sub-categories between the cancer types using the conditions 'Within' and 'Between', respectively. The possible combinations for the conditions 'Within' and 'Between' can be represented using the combination formula C(n,k) as follows:

The possible combinations for 'Within' =  C((CT * ST * DT),2)

The possible combinations for 'Between' = C((CT * ST * DT),2)-[CT * (C((ST * DT),2))]

Thus, for 4 cancer types, each having 4 stages with 2 deregulation types will have total possible combinations as 496 for 'Within' and 384 for 'Between'.

The current tool, can be extrapolated to other user-defined subcategories or disease conditions to effectively identify valuable biomarkers.


**Input File Pre-requisites**
* The input file should be a .csv file with "specific" column headers as a combination of 3 words separated by the character "_".
* 1 word for the main category and 2 words for subsequent sub-categories.
* The absence of sub-categories is accounted for in the calculations. Hence, if there are no sub-categories that the user wishes to specify, this can be replaced with a space between the character "_"

**Column Header Example**
* Main-category: A 4-letter acronym (such as 'STAD' for Stomach Adenocarcinoma). The length of the 4-letter acronym cannot be changed, but, it can be replaced with an equivalent 4-letter acronym as per user requirement for any other cancer type or disease type.
* First subcategory: Can be stage or a different user-defined variable (Ex. STAD_StageI).
* Second subcategory: Can be gene expression pattern or a different user-defined variable (Ex. STAD_StageI_Downregulated).
* If sub-categories were to be absent in the above example; STAD_StageI_Downregulated would be replaced with STAD_[Empty space]_[Empty space]

**Available Parameters**
* Input_Path : [string] path to the input file
* Condition : [string] either 'Between' or 'Within'. Between will find overlap only between two or more cancer types / disease conditions including their sub-categories but not for sub-categories within the same cancer type / disease condition. Within will compare the overlap between the sub-categories of same cancer type / disease condition as well.
* Output_Path : [string] path to the output file

**Output Files**
* Reports the extent of overlap as a percentage, the number of entries that overlap and the entries that overlap.

**Installation**
```
pip install POpCan
```

**Use Case**
```
#=============================Example===========================#
from POpCan import load_example_data_path, get_output_path, Find_Overlap
example_data = load_example_data_path()         #Input Path to Example File
example_output = get_output_path()              #Output Path to Example Output, Saves the output into Downloads directory


#Find_Overlap(Path_to_InputFile, "Between", Path_to_OutputFile)
Find_Overlap(example_data, "Between", example_output)
```
