# computils
A package collecting utilities and other convenient functionality for various numerical computations:
* Numerical differentiation: based on finite differences.
* Interpolation: provide a common interface for several useful interpolators from the excellent 'splines' and 'scipy.interpolate' packages.
* Numerical optimization: transformation functions to impose constraints using unconstrained optimization algorithms.
* Fast or robust python implementations of certain matrix operations.
* Sorting, timing, and other utilities.
