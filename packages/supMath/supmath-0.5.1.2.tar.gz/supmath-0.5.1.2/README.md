#supMath Library#

##What is this##
This module contains plenty of different mathematical functions and operators
which can be used in loads of operations.

##Quick Guide##
Library consists of 3 modules: supOperators, supGeometry and supConverters.
Here are some funcs from supOperators module:

	sigma(start,end,rule):
		Returns the sum of rules with i in range[start,end]

		sigma(1,4,"i+2") => 

		You should be careful with these type funcs, as to transform string formula to an operating one,
		eval() func is used - You have been warned!

		There is also an advanced version where powers are introduced the way they
		are in int_sum(power,n)

	div_sigma(num,power,aliquocy):
		Returns sum of all num's divs raising each div to the power.
		aliquocy is 1 ==> the num**power is subtracted from result.

		It can be a powerful tool when working with nums and their properties.
		With help of this, you can check if num is prime or perfect.
	
	int_sum(power,n):
		Returns the int sum from 1 to n (power = 1):
				
			int_sum(1,4) => 1+2+3+4 => 10
		
		Increasing the power, returns sum of sums of ints from 1 to n.

			int_sum(2,4) => int_sum(1,1) + int_sum(1,2) + int_sum(1,3) + int_sum(1,4) => 20

		You can increase the power indefinitely.
		This tool gives an opportunity to work with Pascal triangle and its sequences.
		Func actually returns n-th unit of (power+2)-th sequence in Pascal triangle.

supGeometry module contains various geometrical formulas, more of them are coming in further library updates:
		
	pythagor(a,b):
		returns the hypotenuse value => sqrt(a**2+b**2)

	circle_area(r):	
		returns circle's area with radiues given => pi*r**2

supConverters module has a range of measure-to measure and numerical converting functions:

	convert(num,scale_base):
		Converts decimal to any notation scale:
			
			convert(2,2) => 10
			convert(10,16) => A
			
		As you can see, letters are supported.

	lb_to_kg(lb):
		Converts pounds to kilograms.
		kg_to_lb(kg) is also supported
