[![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/DCC-EX_py.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/DCC-EX_py)


A simple way to connect to your DCC-EX controlled model railroad using python code without having to write DCC-EX commands in manually.

[DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com/#gsc.tab=0) is an Arduino powered DIY tool for running DCC model trains on a layout.
This package wraps the protocol described in the [DCC-EX Native Command Detailed Reference](https://dcc-ex.com/reference/software/command-reference.html#gsc.tab=0) to be easy to use from python code.

This package is in early development, breaking changes may happen until it is marked version 1.0.

## Features

-   Connects to a DCC-EX base station and wraps commands to make automating layouts easier.
-   Parses feedback from the command station and provides callbacks for important events.
-   TODO (Will get documentation and examples later)

<sub><sup>This project is not an official DCC-EX project nor is it endorsed by them. I just used the name that best decribes the funcionality and will change it if it creates issues.</sup></sub>
