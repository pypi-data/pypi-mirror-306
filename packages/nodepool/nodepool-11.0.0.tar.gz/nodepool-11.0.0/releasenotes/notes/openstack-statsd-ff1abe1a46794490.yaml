    Nodepool 0.3.6 introduced an unintended behaviour change with
    ``openstacksdk`` ``statsd`` reporting.  Due to a change in the way
    nodepool manages OpenStack API calls, all API related statistics
    created during interaction with clouds are now generated by
    ``openstacksdk`` and prefixed with ``openstack.api`` instead of
    being created by nodepool and prefixed with
    ``nodepool.provider.<cloud>`` as in prior versions.  If you wish
    to revert to the prior behaviour, changes have been provided to
    ``openstacksdk`` to allow setting custom prefixes via the cloud
    configuration file; see `statsd documentation
    <https://zuul-ci.org/docs/nodepool/installation.html#statsd-and-graphite>`__
