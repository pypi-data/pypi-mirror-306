    A new configuration option for K8s Pod type labels was added to limit the
    amount of ephemeral storage allocatable in a container (cf. `K8s Local
    ephemeral storage resource documentation`
    <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#local-ephemeral-storage`__)
    This limit can be set via the integer value of

    :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.labels.storage`

    and is treated as Megabytes. Also, a pool-scoped default value can be
    specified via

    :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.default-label-storage`
