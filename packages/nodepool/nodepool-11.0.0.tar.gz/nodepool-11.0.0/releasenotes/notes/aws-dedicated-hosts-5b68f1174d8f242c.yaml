    Limited support for AWS dedicated hosts is now available using the
    :attr:`providers.[aws].pools.labels.dedicated-host` option.  This
    allows for a dedicated host to be allocated to serve a single
    instance (the dedicated host can not be used for multiple
    instances).  This enables Nodepool to launch certain instance
    types which require dedicated hosts.
