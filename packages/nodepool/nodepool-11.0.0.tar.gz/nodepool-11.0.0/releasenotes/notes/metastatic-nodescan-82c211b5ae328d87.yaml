    The metastatic driver now includes the
    :attr:`providers.[metastatic].pools.host-key-checking` and
    :attr:`providers.[metastatic].pools.labels.host-key-checking`
    options.  This can be used to verify that a backing node is still
    functioning correctly before allocating new metastatic nodes to
    it.
