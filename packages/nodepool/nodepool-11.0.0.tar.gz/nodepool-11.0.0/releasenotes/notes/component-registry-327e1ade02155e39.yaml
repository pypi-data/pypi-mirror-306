upgrade:
  - |
    Due to an internal change in how Nodepool launchers communicate
    with each other, all launchers should be upgraded to the same
    version within a short period of time.

    They will generally continue to work at different versions, but
    the mechanism that allows them to yield to specific providers when
    requested is being changed and so that will not function correctly
    unless they are upgraded near-simultaneously.
