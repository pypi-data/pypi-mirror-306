    Added the option to set quota on resources on a per-tenant basis (i.e.
    Zuul tenants).

    A new top-level config structure ``tenant-resource-limits`` has been added
    under which one can specify a number of tenants, each with ``max-servers``,
    ``max-cores``, and ``max-ram`` limits.  These limits are valid globally,
    i.e., for all providers. This differs from currently existing provider and
    pool quotas, which only are considered for nodes of the same provider.
    This feature is optional and tenant quotas are ignored for any NodeRequests
    that do not deliver tenant information with them. Also no quota is
    evaluated for tenants that have no limits configured for them.
