    In the OpenStack driver, when using ```min-ram``` in combination
    with a ```flavor-name```, the first flavor to be found that
    satisfied the ```min-ram``` requirements and contained the
    substring ``flavor-name``` would be used.  The order of the
    flavors to be searched was dependent on what the cloud returned.
    From this release, the available flavors are now alphabetically
    sorted before matching ```flavor-name```.
