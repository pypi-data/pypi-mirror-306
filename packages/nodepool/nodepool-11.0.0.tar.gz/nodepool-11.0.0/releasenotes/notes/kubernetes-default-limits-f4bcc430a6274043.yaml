    Config options for kubernetes providers were added to define default limits
    for cpu and memory for pod-type labels.

    * :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.default-label-cpu`
    * :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.default-label-memory`

    These values will apply to all pod-type labels within the same pool that do
    not override these limits. This allows to enforce resource limits on pod
    labels. It thereby enables to account for pool and tenant quotas in terms
    of cpu and memory consumption. New config options for kubernetes pools
    therefore also include

    * :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.max-cores`
    * :attr:`providers.[kubernetes].pools.max-ram`

    The exsisting tenant quota settings apply accordingly. Note that cpu and
    memory quotas can still not be considered for labels that do not specify
    any limits, i.e. neither a pool default, nor label specific limit is set.
