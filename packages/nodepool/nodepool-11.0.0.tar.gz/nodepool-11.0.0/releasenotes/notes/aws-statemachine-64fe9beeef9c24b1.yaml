  The AWS driver has been updated to achieve parity with other
  Nodepool drivers.
features:
  - |
    The AWS driver now supports rate limiting.  It utilizes a two-tier
    rate limiting system to match AWS's request token buckets.  The
    rate specified in the config file is used as the rate for mutating
    requests.  Non-mutating requests will have their rate limited to
    10 times that amount.
  - |
    The AWS driver now supports quota.  AWS only provides a quota
    value for the number of cores.
  - |
    The AWS driver now support diskimage uploads.
  - |
    The AWS driver uses a new state machine framework within Nodepool
    with significant caching in order to improve performance at scale.
  - |
    The AWS driver now supports IPv6 addresses.
upgrade:
  - |
    The AWS driver will now ignore the "Name" tag if specified.
    Instead, it matches the behavior of other Nodepool drivers and
    sets the instance name to the Nodepool hostname (which is derived
    from the node name; e.g, "np0000000001")
deprecations:
  - |
    In AWS providers, the ``public-ip-address`` setting is deprecated.
    Use ``public-ipv4`` or ``public-ipv6`` instead.
  - |
    In AWS providers, specifying image filter values as non-string
    values is deprecated.  The current behavior is that Nodepool
    coerces non-string values (such as ``true`` or integers) into
    strings, but a later version of Nodepool will produce an error.
    Please update config files to use literal (quoted if necessary)
    YAML strings.
