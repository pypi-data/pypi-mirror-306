    The AWS and Azure drivers now support adding tags to images via
    the :attr:`providers.[aws].diskimages.tags`, and
    :attr:`providers.[azure].diskimages.tags` attributes.  The
    OpenStack driver already supported similar behavior with its
    `meta` attribute.

    The :attr:`diskimages.metadata` attribute has been added and will
    supply default values to the provider image tag attributes
    mentioned above.
