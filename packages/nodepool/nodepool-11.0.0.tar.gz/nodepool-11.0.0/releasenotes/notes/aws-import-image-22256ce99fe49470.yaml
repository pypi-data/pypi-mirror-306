    The AWS driver now supports importing images using either the
    "image" or "snapshot" import methods.  The "snapshot" method is
    the current behavior and remains the default and is the fastest
    and most efficient in most circumstances.  The "image" method is
    available for images which require certain AWS licensing metadata
    that can only be added via that method.
