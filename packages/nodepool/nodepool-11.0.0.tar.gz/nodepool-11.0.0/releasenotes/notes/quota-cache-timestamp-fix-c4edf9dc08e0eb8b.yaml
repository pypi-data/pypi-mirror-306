    Fixes an exception that was raised by the OpenStack driver when attempting
    to reset the quota timestamp and `ignore-provider-quota` is `true`. This
    exception prevented nodepool from seeing quota errors from OpenStack,
    causing it to fail the node request instead of retrying as it does for
    other providers.
