    Removes diskimage.meta checks from the OpenStack driver. The limit of only
    5 entries is anachronistic and now removed. Rather than trying to pre-guess
    what OpenStack wants the metadata is now passed as-is and OpenStack will
    reject it at upload time.

    Previously, metadata was checked by nodepool and invalid values would cause
    all metadata to be silently ignored. Now, metadata will be passed directly
    to glance, and an API error will occur. This may mean that images that
    previously uploaded (with no metadata) will now cause an API error when
    uploading.
