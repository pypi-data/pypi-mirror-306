    The Azure driver now uses the "Standard" SKU for all public IP
    addresses.  Previously it would chose either "Standard" or "Basic"
    depending on the selection of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    Pricing for public IP addresses may differ between the SKU levels.

    Standard IP addresses block all incoming traffic by default,
    therefore the use of a Network Security Group is required in order
    to allow incoming traffic.

    If you are not currently using a Network Security Group, then
    before upgrading Nodepool it is recommended to create one, add any
    required rules, and attach it to the subnet that Nodepool uses.

    The Azure driver no longer creates and deletes Disks, Network
    Interfaces, or Public IP Addresses as separate steps.

    Nodepool and user-supplied tags will no longer be applied to
    Network Interfaces, or Public IP Addresses.  This also limits
    Nodepool's ability to detect leaks of these resources (however
    this is unlikely since Azure is now responsible for deleting
    them).
