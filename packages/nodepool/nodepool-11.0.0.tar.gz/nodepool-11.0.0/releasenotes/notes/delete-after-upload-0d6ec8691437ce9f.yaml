    Nodepool-builder may now be configured to delete disk image files
    after uploads are complete, but while the corresponding images are
    still in service.  The :attr:`diskimages.delete-after-upload` and
    :attr:`diskimages.keep-formats` configuration options may be used
    to configure this behavior.
