    """
    Simulates clusters of variable type on a simlation grid of specified size.
    
    Args:
        num_clusters (int): 
            The number of clusters to deposit.
        clustered_pts (Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]): 
            The number of points per cluster. If a single integer is passed, all
            clusters will contain the same number of points. If a pair of integers
            (a, b) is passed, the number of points will be variable and this input
            will specify the lower (a) and upper (b) bounds of the possible points
            per cluster. The number of points belonging to each cluster will be
            selected randomly within the input range [a, b - 1].
        cluster_size (Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]):
            The size of each cluster. If a single integer is passed, all clusters
            will be assigned the same size. If a pair of integers (a, b) is passed, 
            cluster sizes will be variable and this input will specify the lower (a)
            and upper (b) bounds of the possible cluster sizes. The size of each
            cluster will be selected randomly within the input range [a, b - 1]. See
            specific cluster deposition functions for the definition of size for
            each cluster type.
        noise_pts (int): 
            The number of unclustered noise points to add to the simulation grid
            after depositing clustered points.
        gradient (bool): 
            Sets the character of the noise. False will result in uniform random
            noise, while True will yield an uneven gradient of noise.
        space (Union[int,Tuple[int, int]): 
            The bounds of the simulation plane. A single value will set the 
            upper bound with a lower bound default of 0. A tuple 
            (lower_bound, upper_bound) will set a custom lower bound. These
            bounds are applied to all dimensions.
        cluster_shape (str): 
            The type of clusters to simulate. This can be set to: "circle",
            "ellipse", "micelle", "fiber", or "sphere".
        aspect_ratio (float): 
            The aspect ratio of elliptical or micellular clusters. This argument is
            ignored for circular and spherical clusters (which are fixed to have
            aspect ratio = 1.0) as well as for fibers, which do not have a
            meaningful concept of an aspect ratio.
        fix_AR (bool):
            Sets either a constant (True) or variable (False) aspect ratio for
            elliptical and micellular clusters. If False, aspect ratios will be
            randomly assigned to each cluster by random uniform selection in the
            range [1.0, aspect_ratio), as specified by the aspect_ratio argument.
        precision_params (Union[Tuple[float, float],
                                Tuple[float, float, float, float]]):
            The mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution from which
            localization uncertainties will be drawn, passed as (mean, stdev). For
            3D data, parameters should be specified for both lateral and axial
            precision as (mean_lateral, stdev_lateral, mean_axial, stdev_axial).
        min_sep (Optional[float]):
            The minimum separation between cluster centers. If no input is given,
            the default value is set as follows: for a single cluster_size input
            min_sep = 0.5 * cluster_size, while for a (lower_bound, upper_bound)
            cluster_size input, min_sep = 0.5 * max(cluster_size).
        length (Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]):
            The length of a fibrillar cluster. Fibrillar clusters are deposited
            first by longitudinally growing the fiber backbone to reach the desired
            length, and then growing the fiber laterally around the backbone points
            to reach the desired width. The length grows in integer steps as
            dictated by the rate argument. If the input length is not a multiple of
            rate, it will be rounded down to the the next smallest divisible
            integer. If a single integer is passed, all fibers will be assigned the
            same length. If a pair of integers (a, b) is passed, the length of each
            fiber will be variable and this input will specify the lower (a) and
            upper (b) bounds of the possible lengths. The length of each fiber will
            be selected randomly from within the range [a, b - 1], and then rounded
            down to the next smallest integer divisible by the rate.
        D (float):
            A rotational diffusion constant that describes the evolution of the
            angle that specifies the direction of longitudinal fiber growth. Larger
            values result in rapid rotational diffusion and more fiber curvature,
            while smaller values result in less rotational diffusion and more linear
            fibers.
        rate (int):
            The rate of fiber growth during cluster deposition. A single integer
            value that defines the euclidean distance between points in the fiber
            backbone. The clustered_pts, length, and rate args all set the number of
            points (density) deposited at each backbone point along the fibrillar
            cluster, according to: density = round(pts / (length / rate)). Ensure
            that the rounded integer for density is ≥ 1 to obtain a valid cluster.
        method (str):
            The method for growing fibrillar clusters laterally after setting the
            fiber backbone. Keyword "random" distributes random uniform points
            within a width = cluster_size centered around the backbone point, while
            "normal" draws points from a random normal distribution with
            standard deviation = cluster_size / 4, again centered around the point
            defining the fiber backbone.
        multi_emitter (Optional[float]):
            An optional floating point value that allows the addition of multiple
            localizations per point. After depositing all clustered and noise
            points, multiple localizations are deposited around each initial point
            within a region defined by its localization uncertainty, in order to
            simulate multiple on/off cycles for a given molecule. The input value,
            which should be > 1.0, specifies the mean of a Poisson distribution. The
            number of localizations at each point is randomly drawn from this
            distribution. If no input value is given, there will only be one
            localization per molecule and the original positions of the deposited
            points will not be modified.
