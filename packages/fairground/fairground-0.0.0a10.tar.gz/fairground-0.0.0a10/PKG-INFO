## fairground Statistical Analysis Utils

fairground provides a comprehensive suite of visuaisation and statistical analysis tools for assessing fairness and bias in selection processes, particularly useful for applicant tracking systems and hiring decisions.

## Core Features

### Selection Rate Analysis

The selection rate analysis tools help visualise and analyse how different groups are selected within your process:
- `plot_selection_rate()`: Creates a horizontal bar plot showing selection rates across selected protected characteristics groups
- `plot_job_selection_rate()`: Generates faceted plots to compare selection rates across different job roles

### Parity Analysis
The parity analysis functions help identify and visualize disparities between groups:
- `parity_difference()`: Calculates the arithmetic difference in selection rates between groups
- `plot_parity_difference()`: Creates a multi-panel visualisation showing parity differences using each group as a baseline
- `plot_parity_difference_scatter()`: Generates a scatter plot heatmap showing parity differences between all group combinations

### Disparate Impact Analysis

Tools for analysing disparate impact and selection rate deviations:
- `disparate_impact_ratio()`: Calculates the ratio of selection rates between groups (also known as the adverse impact ratio)
- `plot_selection_rate_deviation_with_disparate_impact_ratio_value()`: Creates a comprehensive visualisation showing selection rate deviations from equal treatment and disparate impact ratio thresholds

## Key Features
- Flexible Group Analysis: Support for both single and multiple demographic group analysis
- Regulatory Compliance: Built-in support for standard fairness metrics like the 4/5ths rule (disparate impact ratio)
- Visual Insights: Rich visualizations with detailed annotations including:
-- Group sizes (n values)
-- Statistical significance indicators
-- Disparate impact ratio values
-- Equal treatment thresholds

## Example Usage
```
import pandas as pd
from fairground.utils import plot_selection_rate, plot_parity_difference

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv("hiring_data.csv")

# Plot selection rates by gender
plot_selection_rate(df, "Gender", "Selected")

# Analyze parity differences across multiple demographics
plot_parity_difference(df, ["Gender", "Race", "Age"], "Selected")
```
