Trial Division Method:\n- Checks each number individually by testing divisibility\n- Has to perform division operations for each number up to sqrt(n)\n- More computationally intensive per number\n- Simpler to implement but less efficient\n\n2. Sieve of Eratosthenes:\n- Uses a boolean array to mark non-prime numbers\n- Only needs to check numbers up to sqrt(n)\n- More efficient because it eliminates multiple numbers at once\n- Uses more memory but significantly faster\n- Better algorithmic complexity: O(n log log n) vs O(n\u221an) for trial division\n\nThe results clearly demonstrate why the Sieve of Eratosthenes is the preferred method for finding prime numbers within a range, especially for larger numbers.
