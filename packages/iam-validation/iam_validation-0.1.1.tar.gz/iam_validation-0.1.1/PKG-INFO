# iam-validation
Validation of names and values in IAMC-formatted model output against definitions and reference targets

Documentation is currently sparse, but most classes and functions have ample docstrings. More proper
documentation will be added soon.

In the meantime, examples for the basic functionlity can be found in the
`examples` folder.

An online poster describing the package was presented at the 17th IAMC Annual Meeting (2024).
The poster is published at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14015170](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14015170)
