# VDMA-LIF JSON Parsers

JSON parsers and models for the VDMA - LIF (Layout Interchange Format), which is used for defining track layouts and exchanging information between the integrator of driverless transport vehicles and a third-party master control system.

The models are generated from a json schema which can be found in the [vdma-lif repository](https://github.com/continua-systems/vdma-lif.git).

## Install

```bash
pip install vmda_lif
```

## Usage

### Read schema from file
```python
from vdma_lif.parser import LIFParser
schema = LIFParser.from_file("example.lif.json")
```

### Read schema from string
```python
from vdma_lif.parser import LIFParser
schema = LIFParser.from_json(scheme_str)
```

### Convert into json
```
schema_str = LIFParser.to_json(schema)
```

### Write schema to file:
```python
LIFParser.to_file(schema, "example.lif.json")
