E totul în viteză                                                It's all in speed
Delir cât cerul de înalt                                         Delirium as high as the sky

Ochii mei, rușinați, coboară doritor                             My eyes, ashamed, descend willingly
Dar te respir, în acest urban decor                              But I breathe you, in this urban setting

[Refren]                                                         [Chorus]
Mă ucide ea, mă ucide ea                                         She's killing me, she's killing me
Încet...                                                         Slow...
Îmi vrea inima, îmi vrea inima                                   He wants my heart, he wants my heart
Din piept                                                        From the chest

[Strofa 2]                                                       [Verse 2]
E atât de grațioasă                                              She's so graceful
Printre mulțimi de oameni                                        Among crowds of people
Plictisiți pe drum                                               Bored on the road
Și pare un dans ascuns                                           And it seems like a hidden dance
Supuși, dansează doi necunoscuți                                 Submissive, two strangers dance

[Pre-refren]                                                     [Pre-Chorus]
Ochii mei, rușinați, coboară doritor                             My eyes, ashamed, descend willingly
Dar te respir, în acest urban decor                              But I breathe you, in this urban setting

[Refren]                                                         [Chorus]
Mă ucide ea, mă ucide ea                                         She's killing me, she's killing me
Încet...                                                         Slow...
Îmi vrea inima, îmi vrea inima                                   He wants my heart, he wants my heart
Din piept                                                        From the chest
Mă ucide ea, mă ucide ea                                         She's killing me, she's killing me
Încet...                                                         Slow...
Îmi vrea inima, îmi vrea inima                                   He wants my heart, he wants my heart
Din piept                                                        From the chest

[Punte]                                                          [Tips]
Arde pe asfalt și pulsează foc                                   It burns on the asphalt and pulsates fire
Arde, arde revoltat                                              It burns, it burns in revolt
Arde prea frumos, arde inima                                     It burns too beautifully, it burns the heart
Arde, recunosc!                                                  It's burning, I admit!

[Strofa 3]                                                       [Verse 3]
Mă ucide ea încet, încet                                         She's killing me slowly, slowly
Îmi rupe inima, da, din piept                                    It breaks my heart, yes, out of my chest
Tremură ușor buzele mușcate                                      Bitten lips tremble slightly
Iar gravitația mă atacă                                          And gravity attacks me
Fluturi și vibrații calde pe asfalt                              Butterflies and warm vibrations on asphalt
De parcă ne plimbăm desculți, prin pat                           As if we were walking barefoot, in bed
Sirene de incendiu care nu ne pot opri                           Fire sirens that can't stop us
Iar timpul, un nemernic, numără grăbit                           And time, an, counts in a hurry

[Outro]                                                          [Other]
Mă ucide ea                                                      She's killing me
Mă ucide ea                                                      She's killing me
Mă ucide ea                                                      She's killing me
Mă ucide ea                                                      She's killing me
Da, da...                                                        Yes, yes...

### Development Setup

Requires Python 3.11+ and [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).

Install the `console-songs` script with pipx for developement.
```
pipx install .
```

Create an `.env` file with your API keys.
```
CS_GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
CS_MS_TRANSLATOR_KEY=...
CS_MS_TRANSLATOR_REGION=...
```
Reference documentation to get API keys.
- [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com)
- [Azure Translator Resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/create-translator-resource)

Setup a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be able to run `python3 src/songs.py --help` and see usage.

When making code changes, remember to format code with black:
```
black .
```


### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and report coverage.
```
pytest
```


### Publishing

Publish a new version to PyPi.
```
python3 -m build
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
