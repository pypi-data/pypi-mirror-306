Name: bioskin
Version: 1.0
Summary: This package contains the implementation of a neural model that estimates the biophysical skin properties from a single RGB diffuse reflectance with baked occlusion, allowing deocclusion, and spectral upsampling in both the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectra (380-1000 nm). It also contains several practical applications, as well as a gui to perform interactive edits directly over the estimated skin properties
