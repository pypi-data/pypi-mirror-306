Eagle Eye
===============================

Description
-----------
This project was created for the [University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute](https://biodiversity.ku.edu/) to allow for the automatic OCR and digitization of paper collection forms.
While testing and development was done for specific KU collection forms this project was designed to allow for the addition of other form templates.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is supported by the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision?hl=en) but swapping for other handwriting recognition models is possible.


Features
--------
* Batch processing on scanned form images
* Automatic image alignment with support for +/-10 degrees of rotation in the scanned form
* OCR of text in the form via the Google Vision API
* A simple web interface for correcting the OCR detections
* Validators to ensure form data complies with pre-specified formats (i.e. times look like HH:MM)
* Export of data into an Excel workbook for further processing


Requirements
-------------
* [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/)
* A Google Cloud project with the Vision API enabled
  * [Quickstart Guide](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup)
* [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  * Ensure the following commands run successfully in a terminal after installation:
    1. `gcloud config get-value project`
    2. `gcloud auth print-access-token`

Installation
-------------
* #### PyPI
  1. Install via `pip`
      ```commandline
      python -m pip install ku-eagle-eye
      ```
* #### Manual
  1. Clone the repo
      ```commandline
      git clone https://github.com/atcosner/eagle-eye.git
      ```
  2. Open a terminal and change into the `eagle-eye` directory
      ```commandline
      cd eagle-eye
      ```
  3. Create a Python virtual environment for the project
      ```commandline
      python -m venv .venv
      ```
  4. Install the required packages via pip
      ```commandline

Modifying/Extending This Project
-------------------------------
This project was designed to be modified to support additional types of forms and fields depending on what users at
other collections may need. This process involves writing Python which can be learned from a multitude of online
resources including this [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) from the Python developers themselves.

### Adding Additional Field Types
1. Define a new field in `src/eagle-eye/definitions/base_fields.py` by deriving from `BaseField`
   * Use the existing fields as examples for how to structure the new field.
2. Define the corresponding processed field in `src/eagle-eye/definitions/processed_fields.py` by deriving from `ProcessedField`
   * Ensure you define the required `export()`, `validate()`, and `handle_form_update()` functions
3. Add functions in `src/eagle-eye/processing.py` to handle creating a `ProcessedField` from your `BaseField`

### Adding Additional Reference Forms
1. Add a blank unfilled reference form in `src/eagle-eye/form_templates`
2. Create a new file under `src/eagle-eye/forms` with name that matches the reference form
3. Define all supported fields in the new file
   * Support for multiple copies of the form on a single page can be seen in `src/eagle-eye/forms/ornithology_form_v8.py`
   * Ensure that `BoxBounds` in your fields are slightly smaller than the field itself to help with OCR
   * `BoxBounds` coordinates should be based on the blank reference form you created in Step 1
4. Create an entry in the `SUPPORTED_FORMS` list in `src/eagle-eye/forms/__init__.py`
   * You may want to change which form in `SUPPORTED_FORMS` has `default=True` which reflects the default form on the job creation page
5. The form should now be selectable on the `Create Job` webpage

### Adding Additional Validators
1. Create a new file under `src/eagle-eye/validation` or append to one of the exiting files
   * The files are grouped and named based on the type of field data they need to validate (e.g. text vs checkboxes)
2. Define both the `validate()` and `export()` functions for the new validator
3. Apply it to a `BaseField` in a reference form definition (e.g. `src/eagle-eye/definitions/test_form_v1.py`)

### Adding New Export Formats
Currently only exporting to an Excel workbook is supported but this can easily be extended to export the form data in
other formats. The design of the `ProcessedField.export()` function is that it returns a `dict[str, str]` which
represents the columns (dictionary key) and row values (dictionary values) this field wants to export. This data is
built up into a `pandas.DataFrame` by `export_results()` in `src/job.py`. The dataframe then could easily be exported to
any output format.
