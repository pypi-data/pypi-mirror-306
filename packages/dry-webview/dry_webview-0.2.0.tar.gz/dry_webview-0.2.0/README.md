# Dry: give a UI to your Python app using web tech

**Dry** is a minimal, no-dependency webview library for Python that lets you use your web development skills to create user interfaces for your Python applications. Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and leveraging [Wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) and [Tao](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao), Dry is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to integrate—no need for extra packages.

## Why Choose Dry?

- **Familiar Web Technologies**: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design interfaces for your Python apps.
- **Concise API**: Instantiate a `wv = Webview()` object, configure a few settings, and call `wv.run()`—that’s it!
- **Versatile Content**: Load content from HTTP/HTTPS sources or render HTML directly, all without a server.
- **Customizable Windows**: Supports borderless windows and custom titlebars for a tailored UI experience—native window decorations are also available if you prefer.
- **Small Footprint**: The binaries are around 700 KB, which reduce to 200 KB after compression with PyInstaller or UPX.

## Installation

Getting started with Dry is straightforward. Simply use `pip` or `uv` to install:

```bash
pip install dry-webview
uv add dry-webview
```

## Simple, Intuitive Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Dry to create a simple webview:

```python
from dry import Webview

wv = Webview()
wv.title = "My Python App!"
wv.content = "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"
wv.run()
```

## Current Status

Dry is in its early stages and currently supports Windows. Linux and macOS support are planned. Expect ongoing development, new features, and potential changes as the library evolves.
