# CEO Framework

The **Conditional Equality Operator (CEO) Framework** is a Python package for conditionally applying transformations to data based on user-defined criteria. Designed to work with various data types (e.g., images, text, numerical data), it simplifies conditional transformations in ML, NLP, and image processing workflows.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ceo-framework
```

## Usage

```python
from ceo_framework import CEO, ValueAboveThreshold, Normalize

ceo = CEO()
ceo.add_condition(ValueAboveThreshold(10))
ceo.add_transformation(Normalize(scale=0.5))

data = 15
result = ceo.process(data)
print("Processed Result:", result)
```

## Features

- Define custom conditions for transformation.
- Apply transformations conditionally across data types.
- Easily extensible for ML, NLP, and image processing applications.
