Description: TensorFlow Addons is a repository of contributions that conform to well-
        established API patterns, but implement new functionality not available
        in core TensorFlow. TensorFlow natively supports a large number of
        operators, layers, metrics, losses, and optimizers. However, in a fast
        moving field like ML, there are many interesting new developments that
        cannot be integrated into core TensorFlow (because their broad
        applicability is not yet clear, or it is mostly used by a smaller subset
        of the community).
