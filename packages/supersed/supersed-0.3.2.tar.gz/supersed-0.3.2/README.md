```


2. Remove All Blank Spaces in Text Files Within test_files Directory:

```


3. Save Current File Versions to Backup:

```
supersed save
```

## Backup and Restore

- Backup: Before executing any changes, supersed automatically backs up the target files to a .backup directory. To manually update the backup, use the save command.
- Restore: If you need to revert changes, use the restore command to retrieve the original files from the .backup directory.

## Notes

- File Patterns: Use glob patterns to specify target files. For recursive searches, use patterns like **/*.txt.
- Safety: Always ensure you have backups of important files. Use the save command to create a new backup point after satisfactory changes.
