Local setup
===========

These instructions work for \*nix systems.


Python environment
------------------

#. Create a new Python 3.8+ virtual environment. Activate the venv. I use
   `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. For this
   example, let's create a virtual environment called ``cappr`` using Python's native
   ``venv``::

      cd your/venvs

      python3 -m venv cappr

      source cappr/bin/activate

      python -m pip install wheel --upgrade pip


#. ``cd`` to wherever you store projects, and clone the repo (or fork it and clone that)
   there::

      cd your/projects

      git clone https://github.com/kddubey/cappr.git

#. ``cd`` to the repo and install this package in editable mode, along with development
   requirements (after ensuring that your venv is activated!)

   ::

      cd cappr

      python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

      pre-commit install


IDE settings
------------

For VS Code, you should be prompted to install a few extensions (if you don't already
have them) when you first launch this workspace.

For other IDEs, set Python formatting to `ruff <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>`_,
and set the vertical line ruler to 88. Docstrings use the numpy format and start on a
new line.


Testing
-------

From the repo home directory ``cappr``::

   pytest

A few small transformers and tokenizers will be downloaded to your computer.

Sometimes I get worried about bigger code changes. So consider additionally testing
statistical performance by running an appropriate demo in the repo's `demos
<https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/tree/main/demos>`_.

If you're changing anything about the algorithm, then report the changes in throughput
or latency, and allocated and reserved CUDA memory. The `Banking 77
<https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/blob/main/demos/huggingface/banking_77_classes.ipynb>`_
demo is useful because it's challenging for CAPPr.


Docs
----

To test changes to documentation, first locally build them from the repo home directory
``cappr`` via::

   cd docs

   make html

and then preview them by opening ``docs/build/html/index.html`` in your browser.

After merging code to main, the official docs will be automatically built and published.


Release
-------

`Bump the version
<https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/commit/d1f7dd51fa702c123bdfb0bcb97535995641c224>`_,
and then `create a new release on GitHub
<https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/releases/new>`_. A new version of the package will
then be automatically published on PyPI.

Try to follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ guidelines, even though I
haven't been great at that so far.
