        "description": "TGeometrical imperfections in bridge design account for deviations due to construction tolerances or fabrication errors. These imperfections are critical for components like girders, piers, and arches, affecting their stability and load-bearing capacity. In girders and piers, imperfections can lead to additional moments or instability, especially under axial compression, and must be included in the structural analysis to prevent buckling. For arch bridges, imperfections impact vertical and horizontal buckling behavior, requiring early consideration in design. Geometrical imperfections are primarily considered in ultimate limit state analysis, ensuring the structure can handle real-world loads while maintaining stability.",
