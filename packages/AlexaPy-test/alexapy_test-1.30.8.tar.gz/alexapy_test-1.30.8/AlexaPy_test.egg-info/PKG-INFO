This a forked version only for testing purposes. The original code is property of alandtse and keatontaylor. You can find it at AlexaPy.Python Package for controlling Alexa devices (echo dot, etc) programmatically. This was originally designed for [alexa_media_player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player) a custom_component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

**NOTE:** Alexa has no official API; therefore, this library may stop
working at any time without warning.
