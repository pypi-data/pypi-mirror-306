![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pre--Alpha-red)

An image processing framework for rapid protocol development of phenotype image analysis 

---
## Overview
This framework aims to provide a toolkit & developer framework that streamlines the process of creating phenotype image analysis protocols. 
By providing a structured data flow, developers can create their own versions of computer vision operations and easily integrate it
with other established protocols without having to create entirely programs every time.
