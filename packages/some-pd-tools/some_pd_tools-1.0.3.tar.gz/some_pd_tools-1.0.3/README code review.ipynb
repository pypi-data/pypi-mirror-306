      "\n",
      "    **Some notes**:\n",
      "    - The whole goal of this function is to find differences in DataFrames, once they are found to be equal, the comparison stops. While looking for differences a report is created that will be printed (optionally), returned and saved to a file (optionally).\n",
      "    - The report is the main focus of this function. The goal is to provide insight into how the DataFrames differ (if they do) the usage of the returned tuple might not be needed. However, if more information is needed or could be useful, the variables provided in the metadata might help.\n",
      "    - This function is meant to be called interactively, possibly using Jupyter. It isn't meant to be run as a verification function, although it can be used like that, than might not be advised depending on the specific situation. The function will return a tuple of 3. In the returned tuple:\n",
      "        - The first element will return True if everything is equal in the two DataFrame, this uses df1.equals(df2) but using the sorted columns and indexes.\n",
      "        - The second element will return True if after some modification in the two DataFrames, everything is equal. This check happens after several points in the comparison process.\n",
      "        - The third element will return metadata. This metadata depends on where in the function it was returned. The metadata is returned if the two DataFrames are equal, after some transformation. Or it is returned at the end of the function. The metadata values should be obtained with `.get()` since metadata is a dict and the key might not exist at a given point when returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *A final note*: This functions is a little messy but I think: \"doing something that works is better than not doing something perfect\". There's room for improvement that might or might not be done in the future.\n",
