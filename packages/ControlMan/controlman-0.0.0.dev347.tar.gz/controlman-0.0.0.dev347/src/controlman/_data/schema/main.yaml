title: Options
description: |
  This section contains a full reference and detailed explanation of all
  available options in your repository's control center.
  These are divided into two categories: **non-extendable** and **extendable** options.
  Non-extendable options are those that are required by {{ ccc.name }}
  during workflow initialization, and thus cannot be extended from other repositories.
  These are all stored in YAML files at the root of your repository's control center directory.
  Extendable options, on the other hand, are those that can be freely extended from other repositories,
  and are organized into subdirectories within your repository's control center.
  
  Changing these settings and pushing them to the remote repository's default branch will automatically
  apply the corresponding changes to the entire repository, i.e., branch protection rules will be updated,
  and all corresponding branches will be renamed.
  
  Project: Main project metadata and settings, including
      name, descriptors, copyright, license, citation,
      funding, team, theme, documentation, and contact information.
  Package: Python package and test-suite configurations,
      including build system, dependencies, requirements,
      entry points, classifiers, and other metadata.
  Documentation: Project documentation and UX configurations, including
      website, README files, community health files, and theme settings.
  Issue Tracking: Issue tracking and development configurations,
      including templates and settings for issues, labels, 
      design documents, commits, pull requests, and changelogs.
  Version Control: Version control system (VCS) configurations, such as
      GitHub/Git repository settings, branch/tag names,
      protection rules, and directory structure.
  Workflow: Development workflow configurations for 
      Continuous integration, deployment, configuration automation,
      maintenance, testing, and refactoring tasks.

      Name of the project.

      :::{admonition} Usage
      :class: dropdown note
      
      The name is used to dynamically reference the project in various places,
      such as documentation website, citation data, README files, and community health files.
      It is also used to derive the [package name](#ccc-pkg-name) when not explicitly specified.
      :::

      :::{admonition} Best Practices
      :class: dropdown tip
      
      The project name on itself has no restrictions and can be any valid unicode string.
      However, by default, it is also used to derive the 
      [distribution name](#ccc-pkg-name)
      and [import name](#ccc-pkg-import_name) of the package,
      which have stricter naming specifications.
      While you can separately set these to different values,
      for consistency, it is recommended to **choose a project name
      that is as similar as possible to the distribution and import name of the package**.
      This helps to avoid confusion and makes it easier for others to find, install, and use your package.
      :::

      If not provided (recommended), the default value is the following template,
      which generates the name from the repository name by replacing all hyphens with spaces.

      By default, the title is added to the project's [citation](#ccc-citation-title),
      [package](#ccc-pkg-description), and [repository](#ccc-repo-description) metadata.
      It is also used in various other places,
      such as `title` HTML attributes of project logos and links.

      When a supported `id` is set, all other keys are filled automatically.
      Nevertheless, you can still override any key by providing the corresponding custom value.
      The license is then automatically incorporated into the project.

          [Composite licenses](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/annexes/spdx-license-expressions/#composite-license-expressions)
          can be defined using "OR", "AND", and "WITH" operators with parentheses:
          - `OR`: Allows either of the licenses to be used.
          - `AND`: Requires compliance with both licenses.
          - `WITH`: Defines an [exception](https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html) to the license.
          - `(` and `)`: Grouping of expressions.
          For example:
            - `MIT OR GPL-3.0-or-later` allows either the `MIT` or `GPL-3.0-or-later` license to be used.
            - `LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause` allows either the `LGPL-2.1-only`, `MIT`, or `BSD-3-Clause` license to be used.
            - `LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT` requires compliance with both the `LGPL-2.1-only` and `MIT` licenses.
            - `GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2` adds `Bison-exception-2.2` to the `GPL-2.0-or-later` license.
            - `MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause)` requires compliance with the `MIT` license and either the `LGPL-2.1-or-later` or `BSD-3-Clause` license.
          Custom licenses and exceptions can also be defined
          using the `LicenseRef-` and `AdditionRef-` prefixes, respectively.
          For example, to add a custom exception to the `MIT` license,
          you can use `MIT WITH AdditionRef-My-Exception-1.0`.
          The custom exception `AdditionRef-My-Exception-1.0`
          must then be defined under [`$.license.component`](#ccc-license-component).

      :::{admonition} Automatic Data Filling
      :class: important

      For any person added here, additional information will be automatically filled
      from web APIs, if available (see the [`Entity`](#ccc-defs-entity) object).
      This is not done for other `Entity` objects defined elsewhere in the control center.
      It is therefore recommended to define all persons involved in the project here,

      :::{admonition} Usage
      :class: dropdown note
      
      This is primarily used to automatically maintain a
      [CITATION file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)
      ([Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)) for the project.
      However, information that are only defined here, such as [`authors`](#ccc-citation-authors),
      [`contacts`](#ccc-citation-contacts), and [`preferred_citation`](#ccc-citation-preferred_citation),
      are also used in other places, such as the project's website, README, and package metadata.
      :::

      :::{admonition} Citation File Format (CFF)
      :class: dropdown seealso
      
      This object closely follows the
      [CFF v1.2.0 schema](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md)
      (cf. [in JSON format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/1.2.0/schema.json)).
      However, it is simplified (e.g., `entity` and `person` are merged into [`Entity`](#ccc-defs-entity)),
      and many fields are automatically filled, e.g.:
      
      - `doi` (given you have [activated your Zenodo account](#install-zenodo)),
        `version` and `date-released`are automatically filled for each new release.
      - `cff-version` is automatically added to the file.

      :::{admonition} Supported Syntax
      :class: dropdown info

      [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github),
      PyPI, and Anaconda.org all support markup languages such as Markdown and reStructuredText
      for defining the contents of files.
      That is, when the file extension is in a supported format (e.g., `.md`, `.rst`),
      the contents are rendered as HTML on the respective platforms.
      However, GitHub only allows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) syntax,
      and performs additional post-processing and sanitization after rendering the contents to HTML,
      due to security concerns. This means that only a 
      [limited subset of HTML features](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
      are supported.
      Like GitHub, PyPI and Anaconda also impose several restrictions
      and perform additional post-processing and sanitization.
      PyPI uses the [Readme Renderer](https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer) library
      to render the README file, which only supports a
      [limited subset of HTML tags](https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer/blob/9c2eb81301bc230f2795cf7e6dc2c23f5815ea41/readme_renderer/clean.py#L20-L31)
      and [attributes](https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer/blob/9c2eb81301bc230f2795cf7e6dc2c23f5815ea41/readme_renderer/clean.py#L33-L65).
      Since these do not completely overlap with the features supported by GitHub,
      a separate [PyPI-friendly README](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme/)
      must be provided for PyPI, to ensure that the contents are correctly rendered on the package index.

      Configurations of the project's issue tracking system (cf. [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues)).

      These include [issue form](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
      templates used to automatically maintain issue ticket forms,
      and settings for the project's [issue template chooser]()https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser),
      which is automatically maintained via the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yaml` configuration file.
      
      # GitHub Issues Settings
      This directory contains templates and configurations used when an issue is opened in the repository.

      ## Templates
      The issues templates use the GitHub's [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
      to create customizable web form fields. Each `.yml` file (other than `config.yml`) provides a template for
      a specific issue type. The issue forms use the YAML format, with a series of defined [top-level keys](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#top-level-syntax)
      such as `name`, `description` and `labels`, and a [body syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema)
      to define the form fields.

      Any YAML file created in this directory using the specified syntax will be automatically added to the list of possible
      issue forms that users can select from when opening a new issue in the repository.


      ## Configurations
      The [config.yml](../../.meta/config/issues_template_chooser.yaml) file contains the configurations for the
      [template chooser](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser),
      i.e. the landing page of the repository's 'Issues' section.

      ### Options
      - `blank_issues_enabled`: A boolean value defining whether free-form issues can be opened by users.
      - `contact_links`: An array of dictionaries, defining additional external links for opening issues.
      These options will be displayed alongside the available templates in the 'Issues' section of the repository.

                and can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.

                ID of the [release commit](#ccc-commit-release) associated with the form.
                
                Each form must be associated with a release commit.
                This is used to correlate each issue in the repository with a commit type.
                When a pull request from a development branch is merged into a release branch,
                {{ ccc.name }}$ first determines the corresponding issue of the branch from the branch name,
                and then ascertains the corresponding primary commit type from the issue's primary type label,
                in order to decide which actions to perform on the release branch.
                
                If two or more forms are assigned the same [primary type](#primary-type),
                they must each define a unique subtype.
                The subtype must match the key of one of the [subtype labels](../label/index.md#subtypes).
                {{ ccc.name }} automatically adds the corresponding subtype label
                to each issue that is created using the form,
                and uses that with conjunction with the primary type label
                to unambiguously identify the form that was used to create each issue in the repository.
                It also helps maintainers and users
                differentiate between issues with the same primary type.

            pre_process:
              description: |
                Some issue forms, or some elements of an issue form, may only need to be present
                when certain conditions are met. Instead of you having to manually modify issue forms
                each time one of these conditions changes, {{ ccc.name }} allows you to dynamically
                define conditions for each form and each of its elements, so that they are automatically
                added/removed according to the specified conditions. This is done by adding a `pre_process`
                key either to the form itself, or to specific elements of the form. The value of the
                `pre_process` key must be an object with one of the following keys:
                - `if_any`: The form/element is only displayed if any of the specified values evaluate to `True`.
                - `if_all`: The form/element is only displayed if all of the specified values evaluate to `True`.
                - `if_none`: The form/element is only displayed if none of the specified values evaluate to `True`.
                - `if_equal`: The form/element is only displayed if all of the specified values are equal.

                For any of the above keys, the value must be an array, where the elements of the array
                can have any type (e.g., string, integer, boolean, etc.). For boolean conditions
                (i.e., `if_any`, `if_all`, and `if_none`), the value of each element is cast to a boolean
                in Python, thus for example, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`, and `null` all evaluate to `False`,
                while any non-zero number, non-empty string, non-empty list, and non-empty dictionary evaluates to `True`.

                For example, in {{ ccc.name }}'s default configurations, there are three separate issue forms
                defined for reporting bugs in the package's API, GUI, and CLI. However, your package may only have
                some of these interfaces, in which case it makes sense to only show the corresponding issue forms
                when the corresponding interfaces are present. This is achieved by adding a condition to each form.
              examples:
                - if_any: [ "${‎{ package.releases.gui_scripts }}$" ] # Display a form only if the package has a GUI interface
                - if_any: [ "${‎{ package.releases.cli_scripts }}$" ] # Display a form only if the package has a CLI interface
                - if_any: [ "${‎{ package.releases.has_scripts }}$" ] # Display an element within a form only if the package has scripts
              $ref: https://controlman.repodynamics.com/schema/gh-form-preprocess
            post_process:
              description: |
                {{ ccc.name }} allows you to define post-processing instructions for each form,
                which are executed after an issue is created using the form.

                Issues that are created using GitHub's issue forms are visually not very appealing,
                since GitHub simply creates a new `<h3>` heading for each form element,
                and adds the user input underneath, without any formatting.
                Moreover, there may be some elements that are only meant for the submission step,
                and are not meant to be displayed in the issue body (e.g., checkboxes for agreeing with terms and conditions).
                Therefore, {{ ccc.name }} allows you to define a template for the issue body,
                which is used to reformat the issue body after the issue is created.
                The template must be defined as a string representing valid Markdown and/or HTML syntax,
                where the user input for each form element is referenced (similiar to Python strings)
                using the syntax `{id}`, where `id` is the `id` of the corresponding form element.

                    to the resolution of the issue, and if so, add them as an assignee to the issue.
                    {{ ccc.name }} allows you to do this automatically; first you need to add a `checkbox` element
                    to the form, which asks the user whether they would like to be added as an assignee.
                    Then, add a key `assign_creator` to the `post_process` object of the form, and under that,
                    add a key `if_checkbox` whose value must be an object with a key `id`,
                    specifying the `id` of the corresponding checkbox element.
                    If the checkbox element has multiple checkboxes,
                    you can also specify the `number` of the checkbox (starting from 1) that must be checked.
                    Also, if you have formulated the checkbox label in a way that the creator must be added as an assignee
                    if the checkbox is unchecked, you can set the `is_checked` key to `False`.

              description: |
                Each form must have a unique name,
                which is what is displayed to the user on the template chooser interface
                when creating a new issue on GitHub.
              examples:
                - 🖥 App 🐞 Bug Report 📱 API
              type: string
            description:
              title: Description of the issue form.
              description: |
                In addition to a name, each form must also have a description,
                which appears below its name on the template chooser interface.
              examples:
                - Report a problem encountered while using the library's API.
              type: string
            projects:
              title: Projects to add the issue to.
              description: |
                Optionally, a list of projects can be specified for each form,
                in which case each issue created using the issue form
                is automatically added to all specified projects.
                Each project must be specified in the format `PROJECT-OWNER/PROJECT-NUMBER`,
                where `PROJECT-OWNER` is the username or organization name of the project owner,
                and `PROJECT-NUMBER` is the number of the project in the project owner's repository.

                Note that for this to work, either your project's
                [auto-add workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically)
                must be enabled, or the person opening the issue must have write permissions for the specified projects.
              examples:
                - [ RepoDynamics/3, AAriam/1 ]
              type: array
              uniqueItems: true

            title:
              description: |
                Optionally, a default title can be added to each form,
                which will automatically pre-populate the title field
                when a user creates a new issue using the form.
              examples:
                - "API Bug: "
              type: string

          Different [pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
          can only be accessed via [query parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)
          . Otherwise, the main template directly under [./github] is used.
          
          For example, to use a template file named `my_custom_template.md`, add the following query string at the end of the
          URL: `?template=my_custom_template.md`. A full URL may e.g. look like this:
          `https://github.com/my-username/my-repo/compare/main...my-branch?template=my_custom_template.md`.
          
          - Pull request template filenames are not case-sensitive, and can have an extension such as `.md` or `.txt`.
          - The YAML syntax used for issue forms is not supported for pull requests templates.
          
          By default, the template defined at [./github/pull_request_template.md](./github/pull_request_template.md)
          is used when opening a pull request. To use the extra templates in this directory,
          the `template` [query parameter](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)
          must be added to the URL of the pull request form, defining the name of the template to use.
          For example, to use a template file named `my_custom_template.md`, add the following query string at the end of the
          URL: `?template=my_custom_template.md`. A full URL may e.g. look like this:

          and definition of [discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms)
          to customize the templates that are available for community members to use
          when they open new discussions in the repository.

          To define a form for an existing discussion category,
          add a key-value pair where the key is the slug of the category name
          in the repository. For example, to create a template for the "New Releases" category,
          use the key `new-releases`.

          :::{admonition} Manual Action Required
          :class: attention

          Defining forms here will automatically
          [create discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms)
          in the `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/` directory of the repository.
          However, unlike issue forms, where adding a new template file in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory
          automatically adds it to the list of available issues, discussion category forms only work when a
          corresponding discussion category is already created in the repository.
          Moreover, creating new discussion categories is not yet supported by the GitHub API.
          This means that for each new discussion category form defined here, you must manually
          [create the corresponding discussion category](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions#creating-a-category)
          in the repository. For example, if you define a form here under the key `new-releases`,
          you must also create a category named `New Releases`, or any other name that matches the slug.

                which is a subset of the [syntax for issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms).
                
                Each YAML file defines a form for a specific discussion category, indicated by the
                filename, which must correspond with the slug for one of the discussion categories.
                For example, the template for the "New Announcements" category should be stored in
                `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/new-announcements.yml`.
                
                To be recognized by GitHub, discussion category forms must be stored in the directory `/.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`
                (i.e. this directory).

      These include general GitHub repository metadata
      such as description, topics (keywords), and homepage URL,
      as well as security configurations, merge strategies,
      and section toggles (e.g., Discussions, Projects, Wiki).
      Git settings include `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files.

      Some keys are automatically retrieved from GitHub's REST
      [API response](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-repository)
      during configuration synchronization and are always set to the source repository's metadata,
      meaning that even in forked repositories,
      these keys will always reflect the source repository's settings:
      `id`, `node_id`, `name`, `full_name`, `created_at`, `default_branch`, and `url`.

          When working with a local clone of the repository on your computer,
          you can override these configurations 
          by creating a `.local_cc_config.yaml` file with the same syntax
          in the root of the repository.
          This file is automatically added to the `.gitignore` file
          and thus will not be tracked by Git 
          or pushed to the remote repository.
          This allows you to maintain a local caching configuration 
          without affecting the remote repository.

    title: Directory structure of the repository.
    description: |
      From the seven [main directories](/manual/fundamentals/structure/index.md) in your repository
      that {{ccc.name}} manages and works with,
      the [GitHub directory](/manual/fundamentals/structure/github.md)
      and the [Docs directory](/manual/fundamentals/structure/docs.md)
      have fixed paths according to GitHub requirements,
      while the path to the other five directories can be customized.
      As discussed before,
      [Customizing the path to the control center directory](/manual/control/structure/index.md#location)
      requires a configuration file outside the control center directory.
      The path to the remaining four directories,
      i.e., the [source](/manual/fundamentals/structure/source.md),
      [tests](/manual/fundamentals/structure/tests.md),
      [website](/manual/fundamentals/structure/website.md), and
      [local](/manual/fundamentals/structure/local.md) directories,
      along with the paths to subdirectories of the local directory,
      can be customized using the `path.yaml` file
      in your repository's control center, as described in this section.

      All paths are relative to the root of the repository.

      The `local` key accepts an object with
      keys `root`, `cache`, and `report`. The `root` key must be set to a string defining
      the path to the local directory itself. The `cache` and `report` keys
      correspond to the cache and report subdirectories of the local directory;
      they accept an object with a key `root` that must be set to a string defining
      the path to the corresponding subdirectory, relative to the root of the local directory.
      In addition, they each define paths to other subdirectories of the corresponding cache/report subdirectory,
      each used for a specific tool. By default, the following keys are defined
      for both the `cache` and `report` subdirectories: `repodynamics`, `coverage`, `mypy`, `pylint`,
      `pytest`, and `ruff`. Each of these keys must be set to a string defining the path
      to the cache/report subdirectory for that tool,
      relative to the root of the corresponding cache/report subdirectory.

      You can also add other custom keys under `dir.local.cache` and `dir.local.report`
      for other tools that you use, and reference them in the corresponding configuration files.
      Note that you do not have to specify all keys in the `path.yaml` file;
      for all keys that are not specified, {{ccc.name}} will use the default values.
      Also, you can entirely omit the `path.yaml` file if you do not want to customize any paths.


      For example, if you only want to
      - change the path of the source directory to `my_source_directory`,
      - change the path of the cache subdirectory to `my_cache_directory`, and
      - add a new subdirectory `my_tool_subdirectory` under the report subdirectory
        for the tool `my_tool`,

      :::{admonition} Important Considerations
      :class: important

      - You must also manually create/rename/move the corresponding directories to match the set path,
        in the same commit where you create/modify/delete the `path.yaml` file.
      - All four main directories must be orthogonal to all other
        [main directories](/manual/fundamentals/structure/index.md) in your repository,
        meaning that they cannot be a subdirectory of any other main directory.
      :::

      {{ccc.name}} automatically manages a variety of files in your repository's main directories,
      and performs a number of tasks that require access to these files.
      For example, to run your tests and build your website, {{ccc.name}} needs to know
      the path to tests and website directories. In addition, these paths are used as
      substitutions in a number of other configuration files for your project,
      so that you do not have to manually update these files when you change a path.
      The following are just a few examples of configuration files where these paths are used:
