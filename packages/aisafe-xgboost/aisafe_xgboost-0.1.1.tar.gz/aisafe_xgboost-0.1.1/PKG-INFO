## Installation

```bash
pip install aisafe_xgboost
```

## Usage

`aisafe_xgboost` can be used as either a CLI or a Python package. 
To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
safe-train
```

To use the model in python, run the following command:

```python
>>> from aisafe_xgboost import model
>>> prediction, explainability = model(
    info = info, # Iterable of Length 4 [Patient Age, Sex, Height Percentile, Weight Percentile]
    bruise = bruse, # Iterable of Length 11 [float]
    response = response, # Iterable of Length 9 [int]
    lab = lab, # Iterable of Length 19 [float]
    xray = xray, # Iterable of Length 9 [float]
    video = video, # Iterable of Length 30 [float]
)
>>> prediction 
0.75
>>> explainability 
[("문진정보", 0.5), ("Lab 수치", 0.3), ("X-ray 영상", 0.1), ("진료 영상", 0.1), ("신체 계측치", 0.0), ("멍 정보", 0.0)]
```
