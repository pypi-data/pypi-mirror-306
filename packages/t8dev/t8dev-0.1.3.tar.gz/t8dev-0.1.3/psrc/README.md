t8dev Python Libraries
======================

This `psrc/` subdirectory contains all of the various Python libraries
that come with t8dev, including CPU simulators and the like.

Many functions also expect the environment variable `T8_PROJDIR` to be set
to point to the project directory (the build directory and the like reside
under this). See the `t8dev.path` module for more details.
