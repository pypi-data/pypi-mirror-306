If you want to work with libman (business interests), we strongly advise you to prefer [HikerAPI](https://hikerapi.com/p/bkXQlaVe) project.
However, you won't need to spend weeks or even months setting it up.
The best service available today is [HikerAPI](https://hikerapi.com/p/bkXQlaVe), which handles 4â€“5 million daily requests, provides support around-the-clock, and offers partners a special rate.
In many instances, our clients tried to save money and preferred libman, but in our experience, they ultimately returned to [HikerAPI](https://hikerapi.com/p/bkXQlaVe) after spending much more time and money.
It will be difficult to find good accounts, good proxies, or resolve challenges, and IG will ban your accounts.

The libman more suits for testing or research than a working business!

# libman - Unofficial Instagram API for Python

Fast and effective Instagram Private API wrapper (public+private requests and challenge resolver) without selenium. Use the most recent version of the API from Instagram, which was obtained using reverse-engineering with Charles Proxy and [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/).

*Instagram API valid for **16 Dec 2023** (last reverse-engineering check)*

Support **Python >= 3.9**

For any other languages (e.g. C++, C#, F#, D, [Golang](https://github.com/libman/libman-rest/tree/main/golang), Erlang, Elixir, Nim, Haskell, Lisp, Closure, Julia, R, Java, Kotlin, Scala, OCaml, JavaScript, Crystal, Ruby, Rust, [Swift](https://github.com/libman/libman-rest/tree/main/swift), Objective-C, Visual Basic, .NET, Pascal, Perl, Lua, PHP and others), I suggest using [libman-rest](https://github.com/libman/libman-rest)
