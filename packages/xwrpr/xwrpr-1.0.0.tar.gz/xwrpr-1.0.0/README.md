xwrpr - A wrapper for the xAPI of XTB
=================

xwrpr is a Python library that provides a high-level wrapper around the xAPI for XTB, offering convenient functions for managing both data and streaming commands. Designed to make interaction with XTBâ€™s trading API simple and effective, it provides comprehensive support for data retrieval, account management, and trading operations.

# **Features**

* **User friendly installation**: Easy installation via ```pip```.
* **Comprehensive support**: Supports all data and streaming commands of the xAPI.
* **High level interface**: Manages connection and background tasks automatically.
* **Examples**: Sample code provided for both data and streaming commands.
* **Documentation**: Complete documentation for each command available in docstrings.


<br/>

# **API-Version**
xwrpr relies on the xAPI Version 2.5.0

* [XTB](https://www.xtb.com/)
* [xAPI Protocol Documentation](http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/)
* [xAPIConnector](http://developers.xstore.pro/public/files/xAPI25-XTB-python.zip)

<br/>

# **Installation**

You can install xwrpr via pip:
```bash
pip install xwrpr
```

<br/>

# **Initialization**

* After installation a file ```.xwrpr/user.ini``` is created in your home directory.
* To get accesd to your XTB account via xwrpr, you must enter your XTB credentials in ```user.ini```.
* **Important!**: Make sure this file is secured from unauthorized access
* To change the default location of ```user.ini```, use the ```path``` argument for this.
* Additionally you can enter your XTB credentials directly in the wrapper

## **List of Argumentss** <a name="list-of-arguments"></a>

* All available arguments for the wrapper are listed below:

   * ```demo (bool)```: A boolean indicating whether the handler is for demo or real trading.
   * ```username (str, optional)```: The username for the XTB API. Defaults to None.
   * ```password (str, optional)```: The password for the XTB API. Defaults to None.
   * ```path (str, optional)```: The path to the XTB API credentials file. Defaults to None.
   * ```max_connections (int)```: Max allowed data and stream connections to server [-]. Default and upper limit is 50
   * ```max_send_data (int)```: Max size of data sent to server at once [bytes]. Default and upper limit is 960
   * ```max_received_data (int)```: Max size of data received from server at once [bytes]. Default is 4096
   * ```max_retries (int)```: Max retries for request to server [-]. Default is 5
   * ```min_request_interval (float)```: Min allowed interval for server requests [s]. Default and lower limit is 0.205
   * ```socket_timeout (float)```: The timeout for blocking stream socket connection [s]. Default is 0.1
   * ```max_queue_elements (int)```: The max number of elements in the stream queue [-]. Default is 1000
   * ```dynamic_shifting (bool)```: Flag to allow dynamic shifting of streaming tasks. Default is True
   * ```logger (logging.Logger, (optional)```: The logger object to use for logging. Defaults to None.
 
* Setting ```dynamic_shifting (bool)``` to True, enables xwrpr to dynamically shift stream tasks between streaming connections reducing the risk of queue overflow. For more Information see [List of commands](#list-of-commands-stream)

## **Example** <a name="example-wrapper"></a>

The following example will show how to initialize the xwrpr.
You will find a example like this also in ```tests``` directory.

```python
import xwrpr

# Creating Wrapper
xtb=xwrpr.Wrapper()
```

<br/>

# **Data commands**

xwrpr includes all Data commands of the xAPI exept:
   * ```ping```
</n>
This command is automatically executed in the background.

## **List of Commands** <a name="list-of-commands-data"></a>

* All available data commands are listed below:

   * ```getAllSymbols```: Returns array of all symbols available for the user.
   * ```getCalendar```: Returns calendar with market events.
   * ```getChartLastRequest```: Returns chart info, from start date to the current time.
   * ```getChartRangeRequest```: Returns chart info with data between given start and end dates.
   * ```getCommissionDef```: Returns calculation of commission and rate of exchange for a given symbol and volume.
   * ```getCurrentUserData```: Returns information about account currency, and account leverage.
   * ```getIbsHistory```: Returns IBs data from the given time range. (deprecated)
   * ```getMarginLevel```: Returns various account indicators.
   * ```getMarginTrade```: Returns expected margin for given instrument and volume.
   * ```getNews```: Returns news from trading server which were sent within specified period of time.

* The return value debends on the command. Please see the docstrings of the commands for further information.
* You will find a full documentation of all xAPI data commands here: [xAPI Protocol Documentation](http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/)

## **Example** <a name="example-data"></a>

The following example will show how to retrieve data with xwrpr.
You will find a example like this also in ```tests/test_18_get_symbol.py```.

```python
import xwrpr

# Creating Wrapper
xtb = xwrpr.Wrapper()

# Getting data for the symbol
symbol = xtb.getSymbol(symbol="BITCOIN")

# Printing the data
details = ', '.join([f"{key}: {value}" for key, value in symbol.items()])
print(details)
```

<br/>

# **Streaming commands**

xwrpr includes all Streaming commands of the xAPI exept:
   * ```ping```
   * ```streamKeepAlive```
</n>
This two commands are automatically executed in the background.

## **List of Commands** <a name="list-of-commands-stream"></a>

Unlike the official API, where streaming commands are named get *Command* , the xwrpr library
uses the stream *Command* naming convention. This change was necessary to avoid conflicts
caused by the official API's duplicate command names.

* All available streaming commands are listed below with their Input arguments and format.

   * ```streamBalance```: Allows to get actual account indicators values in real-time.
   * ```streamCandles```: Subscribes for and unsubscribes from API chart candles.
   * ```streamNews```: Subscribes for and unsubscribes from news.
   * ```streamProfits```: Subscribes for and unsubscribes from profits.
   * ```streamTickPrices```: Establishes subscription for quotations.
   * ```streamTrades```: Establishes subscription for user trade status data.
   * ```streamTradeStatus```: Allows to get status for sent trade requests in real-time.

* The return value will be an object of the exchange class. Please see the docstrings of the commands for further information.
* To retrieve the stream data use ```exchange.get()``` for stopping the stream use ```exchange.stop()```
* If the stream data is not continuosly retirieved, a queue overflow could happen.
* You will find a full documentation of all xAPI data commands here: [xAPI Protocol Documentation](http://developers.xstore.pro/documentation/)

## **Example** <a name="example-stream"></a>

The following example will show how to stream data with xwrpr.
You will find a example like this also in ```tests/test_29_stream_tick_prices.py```.

```python
import xwrpr
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Creating Wrapper
xtb=xwrpr.Wrapper()

# Starting the stream of the tick prices
exchange = xtb.streamTickPrices(symbol="BITCOIN")

# Streaming the tick prices
stop_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)
while datetime.now() < stop_time:
    # Get the data
    data = exchange.get(timeout = 1)
    
    if data:
         # Printing the data
        details = ', '.join([f"{key}: {value}" for key, value in data.items()])
        print(details)

# Stop the stream
exchange.stop()

# Close Wrapper
xtb.delete()
```
