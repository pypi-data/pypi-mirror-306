summary: "The Kudryavtsev et al. (1974), or Ku model, presents an
  approximate solution of the Stefan problem. The model provides a
  steady-state solution under the assumption of sinusoidal air
  temperature forcing. It considers snow, vegetation, and soil layers
  as thermal damping to variation of air temperature. The layer of
  soil is considered to be a homogeneous column with different thermal
  properties in the frozen and thawed states. The main outputs are
  annual maximum frozen/thaw depth and mean annual temperature at the
  top of permafrost (or at the base of the active layer). It can be
  applied over a wide variety of climatic conditions."
