KISS Python e2e encrypted FileVault based on `gpg`

## WARNING
**I don't recommand using this as-is.** This a PoC, usable by me because I know what I want to do with it.
- You can use it if you feel that you can edit the code yourself and you can live with my future breaking changes.
- If you want a production-ready e2e cloud with many features, check https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud
  - Ngl they should rename it tho
