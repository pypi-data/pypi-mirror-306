    Rewrite kolla-ansible CLI to python

    Moving the CLI to python allows for easier
    maintenance and larger feature set.
    The CLI was built using the cliff package
    that is used in openstack-cli and kayobe-cli.

    This patch introduces a few breaking changes.
    The changes stem the nature of the cliff package.
    1. the order of parameters must be
    kolla-ansible <action> <arguments>
    2. mariadb_backup and mariadb_recovery now are
    mariadb-backup and mariadb-recovery
