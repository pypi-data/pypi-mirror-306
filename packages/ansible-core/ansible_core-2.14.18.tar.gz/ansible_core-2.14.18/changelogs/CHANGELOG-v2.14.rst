v2.14.18
========

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2024-11-04
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Improve container runtime probe error handling. When unexpected probe output is encountered, an error with more useful debugging information is provided.
- ansible-test - Removed support for provisioning remote Windows 2012 and 2012-R2 instances.
- ansible-test - Removed the ``vyos/1.1.8`` network remote as it is no longer functional.
- ansible-test - Update ``pypi-test-container`` to version 3.1.0.

Security Fixes
--------------

- include_vars action - Ensure that result masking is correctly requested when vault-encrypted files are read. (CVE-2024-8775)
- task result processing - Ensure that action-sourced result masking (``_ansible_no_log=True``) is preserved. (CVE-2024-8775)
- user action won't allow ssh-keygen, chown and chmod to run on existing ssh public key file, avoiding traversal on existing symlinks (CVE-2024-9902).

Bugfixes

v2.14.10
========

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-09-11
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__

v2.14.9
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-08-14
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- Removed ``exclude`` and ``recursive-exclude`` commands for generated files from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file. These excludes were unnecessary since releases are expected to be built with a clean worktree.
- Removed ``exclude`` commands for sanity test files from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file. These tests were previously excluded because they did not pass when run from an sdist. However, sanity tests are not expected to pass from an sdist, so excluding some (but not all) of the failing tests makes little sense.
- Removed redundant ``include`` commands from the ``MANIFEST.in`` file. These includes either duplicated default behavior or another command.
- The ``ansible-core`` sdist no longer contains pre-generated man pages. Instead, a ``packaging/cli-doc/build.py`` script is included in the sdist. This script can generate man pages and standalone RST documentation for ``ansible-core`` CLI programs.
- The ``docs`` and ``examples`` directories are no longer included in the ``ansible-core`` sdist. These directories have been moved to the https://github.com/ansible/ansible-documentation repository.
- The minimum required ``setuptools`` version is now 45.2.0, as it is the oldest version to support Python 3.10.
- Use ``include`` where ``recursive-include`` is unnecessary in the ``MANIFEST.in`` file.
- Use ``package_data`` instead of ``include_package_data`` for ``setup.cfg`` to avoid ``setuptools`` warnings.
- ansible-test - Update the logic used to detect when ``ansible-test`` is running from source.

Bugfixes
--------

- Exclude internal options from man pages and docs.
- Fix ``ansible-config init`` man page option indentation.
- The ``ansible-config init`` command now has a documentation description.
- The ``ansible-galaxy collection download`` command now has a documentation description.
- The ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` command documentation is now visible (previously hidden by a decorator).
- The ``ansible-galaxy collection verify`` command now has a documentation description.
- The ``ansible-galaxy role install`` command documentation is now visible (previously hidden by a decorator).
- The ``ansible-inventory`` command command now has a documentation description (previously used as the epilog).
- Update module_utils.urls unit test to work with cryptography >= 41.0.0.
- When generating man pages, use ``func`` to find the command function instead of looking it up by the command name.
- ansible-test - Pre-build a PyYAML wheel before installing requirements to avoid a potential Cython build failure.
- man page build - Sub commands of ``ansible-galaxy role`` and ``ansible-galaxy collection`` are now documented.

v2.14.8
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-07-18
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- Cache field attributes list on the playbook classes
- Playbook objects - Replace deprecated stacked ``@classmethod`` and ``@property``
- ansible-test - Use a context manager to perform cleanup at exit instead of using the built-in ``atexit`` module.

v2.14.7
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-06-20
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- Removed ``straight.plugin`` from the build and packaging requirements.

Bugfixes
--------

- ansible-test - Fix a traceback that occurs when attempting to test Ansible source using a different ansible-test. A clear error message is now given when this scenario occurs.
- ansible-test local change detection - use ``git merge-base <branch> HEAD`` instead of ``git merge-base --fork-point <branch>`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79734).
- man page build - Remove the dependency on the ``docs`` directory for building man pages.
- uri - fix search for JSON type to include complex strings containing '+'

v2.14.6
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-05-22
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Allow float values for the ``--timeout`` option to the ``env`` command. This simplifies testing.
- ansible-test - Refactored ``env`` command logic and timeout handling.
- ansible-test - Use ``datetime.datetime.now`` with ``tz`` specified instead of ``datetime.datetime.utcnow``.

Bugfixes
--------

- Display - Defensively configure writing to stdout and stderr with the replace encoding error handler that will replace invalid characters (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80258)
- Properly disable ``jinja2_native`` in the template module when jinja2 override is used in the template (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80605)
- ansible-galaxy - fix installing signed collections (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80648).
- ansible-galaxy collection verify - fix verifying signed collections when the keyring is not configured.
- ansible-test - Fix handling of timeouts exceeding one day.
- ansible-test - Fix various cases where the test timeout could expire without terminating the tests.
- ansible-test - When bootstrapping remote FreeBSD instances, use the OS packaged ``setuptools`` instead of installing the latest version from PyPI.
- pep517 build backend - Copy symlinks when copying the source tree. This avoids tracebacks in various scenarios, such as when a venv is present in the source tree.

v2.14.5
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-04-24
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Bugfixes
--------

- Windows - Display a warning if the module failed to cleanup any temporary files rather than failing the task. The warning contains a brief description of what failed to be deleted.
- Windows - Ensure the module temp directory contains more unique values to avoid conflicts with concurrent runs - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80294
- Windows - Improve temporary file cleanup used by modules. Will use a more reliable delete operation on Windows Server 2016 and newer to delete files that might still be open by other software like Anti Virus scanners. There are still scenarios where a file or directory cannot be deleted but the new method should work in more scenarios.
- ansible-doc - stop generating wrong module URLs for module see-alsos. The URLs for modules in ansible.builtin do now work, and URLs for modules outside ansible.builtin are no longer added (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/80280).
- ansible-galaxy - Improve retries for collection installs, to properly retry, and extend retry logic to common URL related connection errors (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80170 https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80174)
- ansible-galaxy - reduce API calls to servers by fetching signatures only for final candidates.
- ansible-test - Add support for ``argcomplete`` version 3.
- jinja2_native - fix intermittent 'could not find job' failures when a value of ``ansible_job_id`` from a result of an async task was inadvertently changed during execution; to prevent this a format of ``ansible_job_id`` was changed.
- password lookup now correctly reads stored ident fields.
- pep517 build backend - Use the documented ``import_module`` import from ``importlib``.
- roles - Fix templating ``public``, ``allow_duplicates`` and ``rolespec_validate`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80304).
- syntax check - Limit ``--syntax-check`` to ``ansible-playbook`` only, as that is the only CLI affected by this argument (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80506)

v2.14.4
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-03-27
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.14/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.14.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Moved git handling out of the validate-modules sanity test and into ansible-test.
- ansible-test - Removed the ``--keep-git`` sanity test option, which was limited to testing ansible-core itself.
- ansible-test - Updated the Azure Pipelines CI plugin to work with newer versions of git.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- ansible-test - Integration tests which depend on specific file permissions when running in an ansible-test managed host environment may require changes. Tests that require permissions other than ``755`` or ``644`` may need to be updated to set the necessary permissions as part of the test run.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix ``MANIFEST.in`` to exclude unwanted files in the ``packaging/`` directory.
- Fix ``MANIFEST.in`` to include ``*.md`` files in the ``test/support/`` directory.
- Fix an issue where the value of ``become`` was ignored when used on a role used as a dependency in ``main/meta.yml`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79777)
- ``ansible_eval_concat`` - avoid redundant unsafe wrapping of templated strings converted to Python types
- ansible-galaxy role info - fix unhandled AttributeError by catching the correct exception.
- ansible-test - Always indicate the Python version being used before installing requirements. Resolves issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72855
- ansible-test - Exclude ansible-core vendored Python packages from ansible-test payloads.
- ansible-test - Integration test target prefixes defined in a ``tests/integration/target-prefixes.{group}`` file can now contain an underscore (``_``) character. Resolves issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79225
- ansible-test - Removed pointless comparison in diff evaluation logic.
- ansible-test - Set ``PYLINTHOME`` for the ``pylint`` sanity test to prevent failures due to ``pylint`` checking for the existence of an obsolete home directory.
- ansible-test - Support loading of vendored Python packages from ansible-core.
- ansible-test - Use consistent file permissions when delegating tests to a container or remote host. Files with any execute bit set will use permissions ``755``. All other files will use permissions ``644``. (Resolves issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75079)
- copy - fix creating the dest directory in check mode with remote_src=True (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78611).
- copy - fix reporting changes to file attributes in check mode with remote_src=True (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77957).

v2.14.3
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-02-27
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- Make using blocks as handlers a parser error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79968)
- ansible-test - Specify the configuration file location required by test plugins when the config file is not found. This resolves issue: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79411
- ansible-test - Update error handling code to use Python 3.x constructs, avoiding direct use of ``errno``.
- ansible-test acme test container - update version to update used Pebble version, underlying Python and Go base containers, and Python requirements (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79783).

Bugfixes
--------

- Ansible.Basic.cs - Ignore compiler warning (reported as an error) when running under PowerShell 7.3.x.
- Fix conditionally notifying ``include_tasks` handlers when ``force_handlers`` is used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79776)
- TaskExecutor - don't ignore templated _raw_params that k=v parser failed to parse (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79862)
- ansible-galaxy - fix installing collections in git repositories/directories which contain a MANIFEST.json file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79796).
- ansible-test - Support Podman 4.4.0+ by adding the ``SYS_CHROOT`` capability when running containers.
- ansible-test - fix warning message about failing to run an image to include the image name
- strategy plugins now correctly identify bad registered variables, even on skip.

v2.14.2
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2023-01-30
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Major Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Docker Desktop on WSL2 is now supported (additional configuration required).
- ansible-test - Docker and Podman are now supported on hosts with cgroup v2 unified. Previously only cgroup v1 and cgroup v2 hybrid were supported.
- ansible-test - Podman now works on container hosts without systemd. Previously only some containers worked, while others required rootfull or rootless Podman, but would not work with both. Some containers did not work at all.
- ansible-test - Podman on WSL2 is now supported.
- ansible-test - When additional cgroup setup is required on the container host, this will be automatically detected. Instructions on how to configure the host will be provided in the error message shown.

Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - A new ``audit`` option is available when running custom containers. This option can be used to indicate whether a container requires the AUDIT_WRITE capability. The default is ``required``, which most containers will need when using Podman. If necessary, the ``none`` option can be used to opt-out of the capability. This has no effect on Docker, which always provides the capability.
- ansible-test - A new ``cgroup`` option is available when running custom containers. This option can be used to indicate a container requires cgroup v1 or that it does not use cgroup. The default behavior assumes the container works with cgroup v2 (as well as v1).
- ansible-test - Additional log details are shown when containers fail to start or SSH connections to containers fail.
- ansible-test - Connection failures to remote provisioned hosts now show failure details as a warning.
- ansible-test - Containers included with ansible-test no longer disable seccomp by default.
- ansible-test - Failure to connect to a container over SSH now results in a clear error. Previously tests would be attempted even after initial connection attempts failed.
- ansible-test - Integration tests can be excluded from retries triggered by the ``--retry-on-error`` option by adding the ``retry/never`` alias. This is useful for tests that cannot pass on a retry or are too slow to make retries useful.
- ansible-test - More details are provided about an instance when provisioning fails.
- ansible-test - Reduce the polling limit for SSHD startup in containers from 60 retries to 10. The one second delay between retries remains in place.
- ansible-test - SSH connections from OpenSSH 8.8+ to CentOS 6 containers now work without additional configuration. However, clients older than OpenSSH 7.0 can no longer connect to CentOS 6 containers as a result. The container must have ``centos6`` in the image name for this work-around to be applied.
- ansible-test - SSH shell connections from OpenSSH 8.8+ to ansible-test provisioned network instances now work without additional configuration. However, clients older than OpenSSH 7.0 can no longer open shell sessions for ansible-test provisioned network instances as a result.
- ansible-test - The ``ansible-test env`` command now detects and reports the container ID if running in a container.
- ansible-test - Unit tests now support network disconnect by default when running under Podman. Previously this feature only worked by default under Docker.
- ansible-test - Use ``stop --time 0`` followed by ``rm`` to remove ephemeral containers instead of ``rm -f``. This speeds up teardown of ephemeral containers.
- ansible-test - Warnings are now shown when using containers that were built with VOLUME instructions.
- ansible-test - When setting the max open files for containers, the container host's limit will be checked. If the host limit is lower than the preferred value, it will be used and a warning will be shown.
- ansible-test - When using Podman, ansible-test will detect if the loginuid used in containers is incorrect. When this occurs a warning is displayed and the container is run with the AUDIT_CONTROL capability. Previously containers would fail under this situation, with no useful warnings or errors given.

Bugfixes
--------

- Correctly count rescued tasks in play recap (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79711)
- Fix traceback when using the ``template`` module and running with ``ANSIBLE_DEBUG=1`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79763)
- Fix using ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` in conjunction with collections in requirements files which specify a specific ``source`` that isn't in the configured servers.
- Fix using ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` when downloading tarballs from Galaxy servers (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79557).
- Module and role argument validation - include the valid suboption choices in the error when an invalid suboption is provided.
- ansible-doc now will correctly display short descriptions on listing filters/tests no matter the directory sorting.
- ansible-inventory will not explicitly sort groups/hosts anymore, giving a chance (depending on output format) to match the order in the input sources.
- ansible-test - Added a work-around for a traceback under Python 3.11 when completing certain command line options.
- ansible-test - Avoid using ``exec`` after container startup when possible. This improves container startup performance and avoids intermittent startup issues with some old containers.
- ansible-test - Connection attempts to managed remote instances no longer abort on ``Permission denied`` errors.
- ansible-test - Detection for running in a Podman or Docker container has been fixed to detect more scenarios. The new detection relies on ``/proc/self/mountinfo`` instead of ``/proc/self/cpuset``. Detection now works with custom cgroups and private cgroup namespaces.
- ansible-test - Fix validate-modules error when retrieving PowerShell argspec when retrieved inside a Cmdlet
- ansible-test - Handle server errors when executing the ``docker info`` command.
- ansible-test - Multiple containers now work under Podman without specifying the ``--docker-network`` option.
- ansible-test - Pass the ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` environment variable through to container commands.
- ansible-test - Perform PyPI proxy configuration after instances are ready and bootstrapping has been completed. Only target instances are affected, as controller instances were already handled this way. This avoids proxy configuration errors when target instances are not yet ready for use.
- ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat inspections of the same container image.
- ansible-test - Prevent concurrent / repeat pulls of the same container image.
- ansible-test - Prevent concurrent execution of cached methods.
- ansible-test - Show the exception type when reporting errors during instance provisioning.
- ansible-test sanity - correctly report invalid YAML in validate-modules (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75837).
- argument spec validation - again report deprecated parameters for Python-based modules. This was accidentally removed in ansible-core 2.11 when argument spec validation was refactored (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79680, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79681).
- argument spec validation - ensure that deprecated aliases in suboptions are also reported (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79740).
- argument spec validation - fix warning message when two aliases of the same option are used for suboptions to also mention the option's name they are in (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79740).
- connection local now avoids traceback on invalid user being used to execuet ansible (valid in host, but not in container).
- file - touch action in check mode was always returning ok. Fix now evaluates the different conditions and returns the appropriate changed status. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79360)
- get_url - Ensure we are passing ciphers to all url_get calls (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79717)
- plugin filter now works with rejectlist as documented (still falls back to blacklist if used).
- uri - improve JSON content type detection

Known Issues
------------

- ansible-test - Additional configuration may be required for certain container host and container combinations. Further details are available in the testing documentation.
- ansible-test - Custom containers with ``VOLUME`` instructions may be unable to start, when previously the containers started correctly. Remove the ``VOLUME`` instructions to resolve the issue. Containers with this condition will cause ``ansible-test`` to emit a warning.
- ansible-test - Systems with Podman networking issues may be unable to run containers, when previously the issue went unreported. Correct the networking issues to continue using ``ansible-test`` with Podman.
- ansible-test - Using Docker on systems with SELinux may require setting SELinux to permissive mode. Podman should work with SELinux in enforcing mode.

- ansible - At startup the filesystem encoding and locale are checked to verify they are UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible - Increase minimum Python requirement to Python 3.9 for CLI utilities and controller code
- ansible-test - At startup the filesystem encoding is checked to verify it is UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible-test - At startup the locale is configured as ``en_US.UTF-8``, with a fallback to ``C.UTF-8``. If neither encoding is available the process exits with an error. If the fallback is used, a warning is displayed. In previous versions the ``en_US.UTF-8`` locale was always requested. However, no startup checking was performed to verify the locale was successfully configured.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add a new "INVENTORY_UNPARSED_WARNING" flag add to hide the "No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available" warning
- Add an 'action_plugin' field for modules in runtime.yml plugin_routing.

  This fixes module_defaults by supporting modules-as-redirected-actions
  without redirecting module_defaults entries to the common action.

  .. code: yaml

     plugin_routing:
       action:
         facts:
           redirect: ns.coll.eos
         command:
           redirect: ns.coll.eos
       modules:
         facts:
           redirect: ns.coll.eos_facts
         command:
           redirect: ns.coll.eos_command

  With the runtime.yml above for ns.coll, a task such as

  .. code: yaml

     - hosts: all
       module_defaults:
         ns.coll.eos_facts: {'valid_for_eos_facts': 'value'}
         ns.coll.eos_command: {'not_valid_for_eos_facts': 'value'}
       tasks:
         - ns.coll.facts:

  will end up with defaults for eos_facts and eos_command
  since both modules redirect to the same action.

  To select an action plugin for a module without merging
  module_defaults, define an action_plugin field for the resolved
  module in the runtime.yml.

  .. code: yaml

     plugin_routing:
       modules:
         facts:
           redirect: ns.coll.eos_facts
           action_plugin: ns.coll.eos
         command:
           redirect: ns.coll.eos_command
           action_plugin: ns.coll.eos

  The action_plugin field can be a redirected action plugin, as
  it is resolved normally.

  Using the modified runtime.yml, the example task will only use
  the ns.coll.eos_facts defaults.
- Add support for parsing ``-a`` module options as JSON and not just key=value arguments - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78112
- Added Kylin Linux Advanced Server OS in RedHat OS Family.
- Allow ``when`` conditionals to be used on ``flush_handlers`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77616)
- Allow meta tasks to be used as handlers.
- Display - The display class will now proxy calls to Display.display via the queue from forks/workers to be handled by the parent process for actual display. This reduces some reliance on the fork start method and improves reliability of displaying messages.
- Jinja version test - Add pep440 version_type for version test. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78288)

- ansible-connection now supports verbosity directly on cli
- ansible-console added 'collections' command to match playbook keyword.

- apt_repository remove dependency on apt-key and use gpg + /usr/share/keyrings directly instead
- apt_repository will use the trust repo directories in order of preference (more appropriate to less) as they exist on the target.
- blockinfile - The presence of the multiline flag (?m) in the regular expression for insertafter opr insertbefore controls whether the match is done line by line or with multiple lines (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75090).
- calls to listify_lookup_plugin_terms in core do not pass in loader/dataloader anymore.
- collections - ``ansible-galaxy collection build`` can now utilize ``MANIFEST.in`` style directives from ``galaxy.yml`` instead of ``build_ignore`` effectively inverting the logic from include by default, to exclude by default. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78422)
- config manager, move templating into main query function in config instead of constants
- config manager, remove updates to configdata as it is mostly unused
- configuration entry INTERPRETER_PYTHON_DISTRO_MAP is now 'private' and won't show up in normal configuration queries and docs, since it is not 'settable' this avoids user confusion.

- documentation construction now gives more information on error.
- facts - add OSMC to Debian os_family mapping
- get_url - permit to pass to parameter ``checksum`` an URL pointing to a file containing only a checksum (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/54390).

- urls - Add support to specify SSL/TLS ciphers to use during a request (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78633)
- validate-modules - Allow ``type: raw`` on a module return type definition for values that have a dynamic type
- version output now includes the path to the python executable that Ansible is running under
- yum_repository - do not give the ``async`` parameter a default value anymore, since this option is deprecated in RHEL 8. This means that ``async = 1`` won't be added to repository files if omitted, but it can still be set explicitly if needed.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Allow for lazy evaluation of Jinja2 expressions (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/56017)
- The default ansible-galaxy role skeletons no longer contain .travis.yml files. You can configure ansible-galaxy to use a custom role skeleton that contains a .travis.yml file to continue using Galaxy's integration with Travis CI.
- ansible - At startup the filesystem encoding and locale are checked to verify they are UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible - Increase minimum Python requirement to Python 3.9 for CLI utilities and controller code
- ansible-test - At startup the filesystem encoding is checked to verify it is UTF-8. If not, the process exits with an error reporting the errant encoding.
- ansible-test - At startup the locale is configured as ``en_US.UTF-8``, with a fallback to ``C.UTF-8``. If neither encoding is available the process exits with an error. If the fallback is used, a warning is displayed. In previous versions the ``en_US.UTF-8`` locale was always requested. However, no startup checking was performed to verify the locale was successfully configured.
- ansible-test validate-modules - Removed the ``missing-python-doc`` error code in validate modules, ``missing-documentation`` is used instead for missing PowerShell module documentation.
- strategy plugins - Make ``ignore_unreachable`` to increase ``ignored`` and ``ok`` and  counter, not ``skipped`` and ``unreachable``. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77690)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Encryption - Deprecate use of the Python crypt module due to it's impending removal from Python 3.13
- PlayContext.verbosity is deprecated and will be removed in 2.18. Use ansible.utils.display.Display().verbosity as the single source of truth.
- ``DEFAULT_FACT_PATH``, ``DEFAULT_GATHER_SUBSET`` and ``DEFAULT_GATHER_TIMEOUT`` are deprecated and will be removed in 2.18. Use ``module_defaults`` keyword instead.
- ``PlayIterator`` - deprecate ``cache_block_tasks`` and ``get_original_task`` which are noop and unused.
- ``Templar`` - deprecate ``shared_loader_obj`` option which is unused. ``ansible.plugins.loader`` is used directly instead.
- listify_lookup_plugin_terms, deprecate 'loader/dataloader' parameter as it not used.
- vars plugins - determining whether or not to run ansible.legacy vars plugins with the class attribute REQUIRES_WHITELIST is deprecated, set REQUIRES_ENABLED instead.

- ansible-galaxy - Fix exit codes for role search and delete (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78516)
- ansible-galaxy - Fix loading boolean server options so False doesn't become a truthy string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77416).
- ansible-galaxy - Fix reinitializing the whole collection directory with ``ansible-galaxy collection init ns.coll --force``. Now directories and files that are not included in the collection skeleton will be removed.
- ansible-galaxy - Fix unhandled traceback if a role's dependencies in meta/main.yml or meta/requirements.yml are not lists.
- ansible-galaxy - do not require mandatory keys in the ``galaxy.yml`` of source collections when listing them (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70180).
- ansible-galaxy - fix installing collections that have dependencies in the metadata set to null instead of an empty dictionary (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77560).
- ansible-galaxy - fix listing collections that contains metadata but the namespace or name are not strings.
- ansible-galaxy - fix missing meta/runtime.yml in default galaxy skeleton used for ansible-galaxy collection init

- ansible-galaxy - handle unsupported versions of resolvelib gracefully.
- ansible-galaxy --ignore-certs now has proper precedence over configuration
- ansible-test - Add ``wheel < 0.38.0`` constraint for Python 3.6 and earlier.
- ansible-test - Allow disabled, unsupported, unstable and destructive integration test targets to be selected using their respective prefixes.
- ansible-test - Allow unstable tests to run when targeted changes are made and the ``--allow-unstable-changed`` option is specified (resolves https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74213).
- ansible-test - Always remove containers after failing to create/run them. This avoids leaving behind created containers when using podman.
- ansible-test - Correctly detect when running as the ``root`` user (UID 0) on the origin host. The result of the detection was incorrectly being inverted.
- ansible-test - Delegation for commands which generate output for programmatic consumption no longer redirect all output to stdout. The affected commands and options are ``shell``, ``sanity --lint``, ``sanity --list-tests``, ``integration --list-targets``, ``coverage analyze``
- ansible-test - Delegation now properly handles arguments given after ``--`` on the command line.
- ansible-test - Don't fail if network cannot be disconnected (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77472)
- ansible-test - Fix bootstrapping of Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 remotes.
- ansible-test - Fix broken documentation link for ``aws`` test plugin error messages.
- ansible-test - Fix change detection for ansible-test's own integration tests.
- ansible-test - Fix internal validation of remote completion configuration.
- ansible-test - Fix skipping of tests marked ``needs/python`` on the origin host.
- ansible-test - Fix skipping of tests marked ``needs/root`` on the origin host.
- ansible-test - Prevent ``--target-`` prefixed options for the ``shell`` command from being combined with legacy environment options.
- ansible-test - Sanity test output with the ``--lint`` option is no longer mixed in with bootstrapping output.
- ansible-test - Subprocesses are now isolated from the stdin, stdout and stderr of ansible-test. This avoids issues with subprocesses tampering with the file descriptors, such as SSH making them non-blocking. As a result of this change, subprocess output from unit and integration tests on stderr now go to stdout.
- ansible-test - Subprocesses no longer have access to the TTY ansible-test is connected to, if any. This maintains consistent behavior between local testing and CI systems, which typically do not provide a TTY. Tests which require a TTY should use pexpect or another mechanism to create a PTY.
- ansible-test - Temporary executables are now verified as executable after creation. Without this check, path injected scripts may not be found, typically on systems with ``/tmp`` mounted using the "noexec" option. This can manifest as a missing Python interpreter, or use of the wrong Python interpreter, as well as other error conditions.
- ansible-test - Test configuration for collections is now parsed only once, prior to delegation. Fixes issue: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78334
- ansible-test - Test containers are now run with the ``--tmpfs`` option for ``/tmp``, ``/run`` and ``/run/lock``. This allows use of containers built without the ``VOLUME`` instruction. Additionally, containers with those volumes defined no longer create anonymous volumes for them. This avoids leaving behind volumes on the container host after the container is stopped and deleted.
- ansible-test - The ``shell`` command no longer redirects all output to stdout when running a provided command. Any command output written to stderr will be mixed with the stderr output from ansible-test.
- ansible-test - The ``shell`` command no longer requests a TTY when using delegation unless an interactive shell is being used. An interactive shell is the default behavior when no command is given to pass to the shell.
- ansible-test - Update the ``pylint`` sanity test requirements to resolve crashes on Python 3.11. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78882)
- ansible-test - Update the ``pylint`` sanity test to use version 2.15.4.
- ansible-test - Update the ``pylint`` sanity test to use version 2.15.5.
- ansible-test - ansible-doc sanity test - Correctly determine the fully-qualified collection name for plugins in subdirectories, resolving https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78490.
- ansible-test - validate-modules - Documentation-only modules, used for documenting actions, are now allowed to have docstrings (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77972).
- ansible-test compile sanity test - do not crash if a column could not be determined for an error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77465).
- apt - Fix module failure when a package is not installed and only_upgrade=True. Skip that package and check the remaining requested packages for upgrades. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78762)
- apt - don't actually update the cache in check mode with update_cache=true.
- apt - don't mark existing packages as manually installed in check mode (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66413).
- apt - fix package selection to include /etc/apt/preferences(.d) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77969)
- apt module now correctly handles virtual packages.
- apt module should not traceback on invalid type given as package. issue 78663.
- arg_spec - Fix incorrect ``no_log`` warning when a parameter alias is used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77576)
- callback plugins - do not crash when ``exception`` passed from a module is not a string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75726, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77781).
- cli now emits clearer error on no hosts selected
- config, ensure that pulling values from configmanager are templated if possible.
- display itself should be single source of 'verbosity' level to the engine.
- dnf - Condense a few internal boolean returns.
- dnf - The ``nobest`` option now also works for ``state=latest``.
- dnf - The ``skip_broken`` option is now used in installs (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73072).
- dnf - fix output parsing on systems with ``LANGUAGE`` set to a language other than English (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78193)
- facts - fix IP address discovery for specific interface names (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77792).
- facts - fix processor facts on AIX: correctly detect number of cores and threads, turn ``processor`` into a list (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78223).
- fetch_file - Ensure we only use the filename when calculating a tempfile, and do not incude the query string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/29680)
- fetch_file - properly split files with multiple file extensions (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75257)

- file backed cache plugins now handle concurrent access by making atomic updates to the files.
- git module fix docs and proper use of ssh wrapper script and GIT_SSH_COMMAND depending on version.
- handlers - fix an issue where the ``flush_handlers`` meta task could not be used with FQCN: ``ansible.builtin.meta`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79023)
- if a config setting prevents running ansible it should at least show it's "origin".
- include module - add docs url to include deprecation message (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76684).
- items2dict - Handle error if an item is not a dictionary or is missing the required keys (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70337).
- keyword inheritance - Ensure that we do not squash keywords in validate (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79021)
- known_hosts - do not return changed status when a non-existing key is removed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78598)
- local facts - if a local fact in the facts directory cannot be stated, store an error message as the fact value and emit a warning just as if just as if the facts execution has failed. The stat can fail e.g. on dangling symlinks.
- lookup plugin - catch KeyError when lookup returns dictionary (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77789).
- module_utils - Make distro.id() report newer versions of OpenSuSE (at least >=15) also report as ``opensuse``. They report themselves as ``opensuse-leap``.
- module_utils.service - daemonize - Avoid modifying the list of file descriptors while iterating over it.
- null_representation config entry changed to 'raw' as it must allow 'none/null' and empty string.
- omit on keywords was resetting to default value, ignoring inheritance.

- paramiko - Add back support for ``ssh_args``, ``ssh_common_args``, and ``ssh_extra_args`` for parsing the ``ProxyCommand`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78750)
- password lookup does not ignore k=v arguments anymore.
- pause module will now report proper 'echo' vs always being true.
- pip - fix cases where resolution of pip Python module fails when importlib.util has not already been imported
- plugin loader - Sort results when fuzzy matching plugin names (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/77966).
- plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (fqcn + short name).
- plugin loader, fix detection for existing configuration before initializing for a plugin
- plugin loader, now when skipping a plugin due to an abstract method error we provide that in 'verbose' mode instead of totally obscuring the error. The current implementation assumed only the base classes would trigger this and failed to consider 'in development' plugins.
- prevent lusermod from using group name instead of group id (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77914)
- prevent type annotation shim failures from causing runtime failures (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/77860)
- psrp connection now handles default to inventory_hostname correctly.
- roles, fixed issue with roles loading paths not contained in the role itself when using the `_from` options.
- service_facts - Use python re to parse service output instead of grep (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78541)

- uri - properly use uri parameter use_proxy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58632)
- uri module - failed status when Authentication Bearer used with netrc, because Basic authentication was by default. Fix now allows to ignore netrc by changing use_netrc=False (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74397).
- urls - Guard imports of ``urllib3`` by catching ``Exception`` instead of ``ImportError`` to prevent exceptions in the import process of optional dependencies from preventing use of ``urls.py`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78648)
- user - Fix error "Permission denied" in user module while generating SSH keys (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78017).
- user - fix creating a local user if the user group already exists (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75042)
- user module - Replace uses of the deprecated ``spwd`` python module with ctypes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78050)
- validate-modules - fix validating version_added for new options.
- variablemanager, more efficient read of vars files
