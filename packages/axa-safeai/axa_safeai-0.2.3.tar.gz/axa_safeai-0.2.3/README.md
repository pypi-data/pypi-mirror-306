### AXA safeAI package

This S.A.F.E. approach is based on “Rank Graduation
Box” proposed in [Babaei et al. 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424021067). The use of the term “box” is motivated by the need of emphasizing that our proposal is
always in progress so that, like a box, it can be constantly filled by innovative tools addressed
to the measurement of the new future requirements necessary for the safety condition of
AI-systems.
