This script updates a dns record in your Cloudflare account to match 
your current public IP address.\
First it checks your IP address, and if it is different from the IP address in your 
Cloudflare dns record, it updates the dns record in Cloudflare.\
It will run automatically at preset intervals.

### Prerequisites
To run this script you need a Cloudflare User API Token \
with the following Permissions:\
Zone - Zone - Read  
Zone - DNS - Edit\
and the following Zone Resources:\  
Include - Specific zone - yourdomain.xxx

These permissions are necessary to check the names and IDs of your dns records (Zone Read)\
and to change the IP address of a particular record (DNS Edit).

During setup, the script checks if crontab is installed and accessible.\
If not, it will exit. In this case setup crontab or run as root.\
In Debian 12 all users have crontab available\
In Alpine linux the user needs to run crontab -e, and write a comment line.

### How to obtain a Cloudflare API Token
Login to Cloudflare\
Click on My Profile (top right)\
Click on API Tokens\
Click on the 'Create Token' button\
Click on the 'Use template' button of Edit zone DNS\
Modify Permissions so that you have the following settings:\
Zone - Zone - Read  \
Zone - DNS - Edit    \
and the following Zone Resources:\
Include - Specific zone - yourdomain.xxx")\
Click on the 'Continue to summary' button\
Click on the 'Create Token' button.\
Save the Token


### Security
The Cloudflare token is saved in a json file readable only by the user (and root).
In my setup, it is in a VM with only one user, so it is not a problem, 
but if your setup is different, please consider this. 

Once '--setup' has run, you may remove the 'Zone Read' permission.\
By doing this, your token will not be able to read your A records. It will 
only have access to the particular record specified in setup.\
'--setup' will not be able to fetch your Zone and dns Record IDs anymore, but
 you will still be able to run the script with all the other arguments.
