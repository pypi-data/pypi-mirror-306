    """
    Decorator addressing the deprecation of combining
    @classmethod with @property in Python. Its purpose aligns with a fundamental
    principle of object-oriented programming: any software is essentially composed
    of code and data. Within object-oriented paradigm - attributes and methods,
    which can be either class-specific or instance-specific. Given this, it is logical
    to have @property for instance-specific attributes and @classproperty for
    class-specific attributes.

class MasterPiece:
    """An object with a name. Base class of everything. Serves as the
    foundational base class for any real-world object that can be a part of
    a hierarchy.

    Logging
    -------

    MasterPiece classes and objects have logging methods e.g. info() and error() at their fingertips, for
    centralized logging. Class methods are prefixed with 'log_' e.g. cls.log_error(), whereas  instance methods
    are named without 'log_' prefix, e.g. self.error().

    ::

        cls.log_warning(f"Some warning {foo}", details)
        self.warning("f"Some warning {foo}", details)


    Factory Method Pattern
    ----------------------

    Instantiation via class identifiers (class name), adhering to the factory method pattern.
    This allows for the dynamic creation of instances based on class identifiers,
    promoting decoupled and extensible design required by plugin architecture.
    ::

        foo = MasterPiece.instantiate("Foo")


    Serialization
    -------------

    Serialization of both class and instance attributes serves as a means of configuration.

    Class attributes should follow a consistent naming convention where an underscore prefix
    ('_' or '__') implies the attribute is private and transient, meaning it is not serialized.


    As Python does not have 'transient' keyword to tag attributes that should be serialized, all
    classes must explicitely describe information for the serialization. This is done with
    `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods:
    ::

        def to_dict(self):
            data = super().to_dict()
            data["_foo"] = {
                "topic": self.topic,
                "temperature": self.temperature,
            }
            return data

        def from_dict(self, data):
            super().from_dict(data)
            for key, value in data["_foo"].items():
                setattr(self, key, value)



    Copying Objects
    ---------------

    Any object can be copied using the `copy()` method. This feature is based on serialization, so
    typically, subclasses don't need to implement the `copy()` method; everything is taken care of
    by the base class.
    ::

        foo2 = foo.copy()


    Event processing
    ---------------

    All MasterPiece objects have been designed to actually do something and therefore
    provided with 'run()' method. By default the run() method just dispacthes the call
    to its payload' object, if provided. It is up to the sub classes to implement the
    method. Typically the method spawns a thread to execute something, enter event or network
    loop, etc. using the following methods:
    ::

        foo.run();
        foo.run_forwever();
        foo.shutdown() #


    Decoupling Data and Code
    -------------------------
    Instead of adding new methods (code) to MasterPiece class the MasterPiece implements
    'do()' method through which any code can be executed.
    ::
        def someCoolProcedure(...):
            ...
        rc : bool = foo.do(someProcedure, someContext)
