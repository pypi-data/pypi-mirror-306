Do you find yourself experiencing mixed feelings towards matplotlib? You’re not alone. 
To address this, I developed a mini-project designed to facilitate data visualization through natural language commands. 
This project relies on dependencies such as OpenAI and matplotlib, and it is remarkably user-friendly. 
By leveraging OpenAI’s GPT API, prompt engineering, and few-shot learning, matplotlib_ai can generate graphs without the need for any matplotlib coding. 
For more details, please visit the GitHub repository:
