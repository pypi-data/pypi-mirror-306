## About this repository

This is the python-library you can use for your project to build `*`.ecmb - files without caring about the internals of the file-format.
You can't do anything wrong with this, coz if you do a mistake (e.g. passing a boolean to set_summary()) an ecmbException will be raised. After the creation, the file will be automatically validated.
