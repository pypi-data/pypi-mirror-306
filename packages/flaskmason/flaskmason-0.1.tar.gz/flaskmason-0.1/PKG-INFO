# FlaskMason

FlaskMason is a command-line tool designed to quickly scaffold Flask applications with a Django-like project structure. It automates the creation of a boilerplate project with organized blueprints, configuration files, and other essential components, allowing developers to focus on building features instead of setting up their environment.

## Features

- **Django-like Folder Structure**: Automatically creates a structured layout for your Flask projects, including blueprints for authentication, admin, and more.
- **Predefined Boilerplate Code**: Generates essential files with predefined content, reducing the need for repetitive setup.
- **Easy Installation**: Installs all necessary dependencies with a single command.

## Installation

You can install FlaskMason via pip. To install it along with its dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install flaskmason
```

## Usage

To create a new Flask project, simply run:

```bash
flaskmason <project_name>
```

This command will generate a new directory called `<project_name>` containing the following structure:

```
<project_name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ blueprints/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ forms.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ views.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ forms.py
â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â””â”€â”€ templates/
```

### Example Commands

1. **Create a new Flask project**:
   ```bash
   flaskmason my_flask_project
   ```

2. **Change directory into the new project**:
   ```bash
   cd my_flask_project
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## File Descriptions

- **app.py**: The main application file where the Flask app is created and configured.
- **config.py**: Contains configuration settings for the application, such as database URI and secret keys.
- **blueprints/**: Directory for organizing application features into blueprints, improving modularity and maintainability.
- **static/**: Directory for static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).
- **templates/**: Directory for HTML templates used in rendering views.
