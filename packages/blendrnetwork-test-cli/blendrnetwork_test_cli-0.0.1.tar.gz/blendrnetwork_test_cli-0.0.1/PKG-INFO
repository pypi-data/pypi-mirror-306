# Blendr CLI

Blendr CLI is a command-line interface designed to help users lend their GPU resources for computational tasks on the Blendr platform. This tool allows for easy setup, management, and monitoring of GPU resources from your terminal.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login to access the Blendr platform.
- **GPU Detection**: Automatically detect and list available GPUs on the host machine.
- **Task Management**: Listen and respond to computational tasks distributed via the Blendr network.
- **Initial Setup**: Configure the CLI tool to optimize performance and resource usage.
