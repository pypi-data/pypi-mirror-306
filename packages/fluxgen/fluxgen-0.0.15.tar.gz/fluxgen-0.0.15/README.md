# fluxgen

> install and configure Flux Framework

![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fluxgen)

This small library makes it easy to generate install scripts and configuration to get flux up and running!
We will run this in the context of a JobSet, with the goal to generate the scripts necessary to install flux, etc.

ðŸš§ Under Construction! ðŸš§

## Usage

Fluxgen has two modes. If you use **create** you will create an install script that installs flux, creates configuration assets,
_and_ starts the brokers. if you use **install** it will just generate the install script.

### Install

Here is how to generate an install script.

```bash
# Preview in terminal
fluxgen install --dry-run

# Write to file
fluxgen install
```
```console
Writing install script to flux-install.sh
```

### Create

Here is an example for using fluxgen to generate an install script for a worker.

```bash
fluxgen create --brokers flux-sample[0-10] command arg1 arg2
```

And the lead broker:

```bash
fluxgen create --lead-broker --brokers flux-sample[0-10] command arg1 arg2
```

Just preview:

```bash
fluxgen create --lead-broker --brokers flux-sample[0-10] --dry-run command arg1 arg2
```
