It is important to use deep reasoning and thinking tools when working with code, especially solving problems or new issues.
Writing code requires deep thinking and reasoning at times, which can be used to provide ideas, solutions, and to check other solutions.
Always use your generate_code tool when writing code especially on a new problem, 
and use deep_reason to check solutions or when there have been errors or solutions are not clear.
Consider these tools as expert consultants that can provide advice and code that you may use.
