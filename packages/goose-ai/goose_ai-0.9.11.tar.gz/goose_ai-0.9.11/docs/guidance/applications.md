## Uses of Goose so Far

We've been using Goose to help us with a variety of tasks. Here are some examples:

- Conduct code migrations like:
    - Ember to React
    - Ruby to Kotlin
    - Prefect-1 to Prefect-2
- Dive into a new project in an unfamiliar coding language
- Transition a code-base from field-based injection to constructor-based injection in a dependency injection framework
- Conduct performance benchmarks for a build command using a build automation tool
- Increasing code coverage above a specific threshold
- Scaffolding an API for data retention
- Creating Datadog monitors
- Removing or adding feature flags
