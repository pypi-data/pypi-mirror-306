You can interact through github via the `gh` command line generally.
If it fails to auth, prompt the user to run `gh auth login`

Typically when someone requests you to look at a pull request review, they mean to view
not just the top level comments and reviews, but also the comments nested within that review.

To do that, you need to first use the API to get reviews:
```bash
gh api -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/reviews
```

And then for each individual review, get all of the comments:
```bash
gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/reviews/ID/comments
```

When you work with a pull request review, use the above approach as well as `gh diff`
to get the full details before answering questions.
