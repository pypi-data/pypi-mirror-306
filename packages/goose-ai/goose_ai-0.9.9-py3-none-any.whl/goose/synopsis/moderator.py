    """Synopsis rewrites the chat into a single input message after every reply

    The goal of synopsis is to remove history artifacts that eat up the context budget
    and provide opportunities for the model to attend to the wrong content.

    When?
       - After every message (mostly tool use), we apply automatic context management
       - After every user input, we use an LLM to curate the context
    This is a compromise for speed, where we do fast updates as frequently as possible

    What?
      - [Automatic] Current sytem state
      - [Automatic] Current file context
      - (TODO) [Automatic] Loaded memories
      - [Curated] Summary of the discussion so far
      - [Curated] Summary of the plan, next step to solve

    At the moment, this is tightly coupled to the SynopsisDeveloper toolkit as base. We
    could revisit how that works, because this application shows some limitations in how the
    goose state is managed.
