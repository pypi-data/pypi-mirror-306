Given a dictionary of files and directories in a project repository, please identify which files should be retained
based solely on their relevance to the core processing code of the project. Exclude configuration-related files and other
non-code files, except for necessary Dockerfiles and Markdown files. You do not need to read or open the files or
directories. Just make an educated guess.

**Important:** Return the file and directory names exactly as they appear in the input list. Do not modify, alter, or
assume different names. Any suggested file or directory must match an entry in the input list.

Return ONLY a dictionary of relevant files and potentially relevant directories that need further inspection. NO
MARKDOWN NOTATION.

Example:

Input:

{
    'files': [
        'LICENSE.md',
        'ARCHITECTURE.md',
        'mkdocs.yml',
        'justfile',
        'CHANGELOG.md',
        'pyproject.toml',
        'README.md',
        'CONTRIBUTING.md',
        'poetry.lock'
    ],
    'directories': ['bin', 'tests', 'docs', 'mlruns', 'scripts', 'src']
}

Output:

{
    'files': [
        'ARCHITECTURE.md',
        'README.md',
    ],
    'directories': ['tests', 'scripts', 'src']
}
