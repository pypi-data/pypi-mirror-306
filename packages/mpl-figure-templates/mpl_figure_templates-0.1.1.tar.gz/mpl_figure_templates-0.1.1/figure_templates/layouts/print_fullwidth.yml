# Template for a full-width figure, on print media.

# The text has a baseline at ~0.25 of the line height.
# To align elements with text (when fig_height is an integer), the x-axis must be at some X.25. Axe heights are X.25 and vsep X.75, so that all axes have an x-axis that aligns with a line of text. The baseline of text elements must also sit at an X.25.
