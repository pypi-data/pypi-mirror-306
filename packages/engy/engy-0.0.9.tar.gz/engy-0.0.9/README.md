## üö¶ Quick Start Guide

### üîß Installation
Get started with:
```bash
pip install engy
```

### üéâ Create Your App

1. Set up your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_awesome_app && cd my_awesome_app
   ```

2. Describe your app idea:
   ```bash
   echo "create a calculator" > input.txt
   ```

3. Add your API key:
   ```bash
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_super_secret_key" > .env
   ```

   The default model is `claude-3.5-sonnet`. You can switch to any model, e.g. gpt-4 by adding the following to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   echo "MODEL=gpt-4" >> .env
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" >> .env
   ```

4. Let Engy work its magic:
   ```bash
   engy
   ```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run Your New App
Engy provides a ready-to-go script:
```bash
bash run.sh
```

### üåà Enhance Your App with More Features

1. Describe your new feature:
   ```bash
   echo "make the calculator support calculus and algebra" > feature.txt
   ```

2. Let Engy implement it:
   ```bash
   engy feature
   ```

### üé® Fine-tune Your Backend and Frontend
Tweak your app's functionality or user interface:

```bash
engy backend
# Enter prompts to optimize your data handling or add new processing features
```

```bash
engy frontend
# Enter prompts to enhance your UI or add new interactive elements
```

### üîß Refactor Your App
To refactor your app's frontend and backend into modular files:

```bash
engy split
```

This command will reorganize your code structure for better maintainability and scalability.

### üß¨ Clone an Existing App
To create a new app based on an existing one:

```bash
mkdir my_app_2 && cd my_app_2
echo "new changes..." > input.txt
engy clone /path/to/my_app
```
