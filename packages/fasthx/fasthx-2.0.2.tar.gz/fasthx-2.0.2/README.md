# FastHX

FastAPI and HTMX, the right way.

Key features:

- **Decorator syntax** that works with FastAPI as one would expect, no need for unused or magic dependencies in routes.
- Works with **any templating engine** or server-side rendering library, e.g. `markyp-html` or `dominate`.
- Built-in **Jinja2 templating support** (even with multiple template folders).
- Gives the rendering engine **access to all dependencies** of the decorated route.
- FastAPI **routes will keep working normally by default** if they receive **non-HTMX** requests, so the same route can serve data and render HTML at the same time.
- **Response headers** you set in your routes are kept after rendering, as you would expect in FastAPI.
- **Correct typing** makes it possible to apply other (typed) decorators to your routes.
- Works with both **sync** and **async routes**.

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed with:

```console
$ pip install fasthx
```

## Examples

For complete, but simple examples that showcase the basic use of `FastHX`, please see the [examples](https://github.com/volfpeter/fasthx/tree/main/examples) folder.

If you're looking for a more complex (`Jinja2`) example with features like active search, lazy-loading, server-sent events, custom server-side HTMX triggers, dialogs, and TailwindCSS and DaisyUI integration, check out this [FastAPI-HTMX-Tailwind example](https://github.com/volfpeter/fastapi-htmx-tailwind-example).

### Jinja2 templating

To start serving HTML and HTMX requests, all you need to do is create an instance of `fasthx.Jinja` and use its `hx()` or `page()` methods as decorators on your routes. `hx()` only triggers HTML rendering for HTMX requests, while `page()` unconditionally renders HTML, saving you some boilerplate code. See the example code below:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates
from fasthx import Jinja
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Pydantic model of the data the example API is using.
class User(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str

# Create the app.
app = FastAPI()

# Create a FastAPI Jinja2Templates instance and use it to create a
# FastHX Jinja instance that will serve as your decorator.
jinja = Jinja(Jinja2Templates("templates"))

@app.get("/")
@jinja.page("index.html")
def index() -> None:
    ...

@app.get("/user-list")
@jinja.hx("user-list.html")
async def htmx_or_data() -> list[User]:
    return [
        User(first_name="John", last_name="Lennon"),
        User(first_name="Paul", last_name="McCartney"),
        User(first_name="George", last_name="Harrison"),
        User(first_name="Ringo", last_name="Starr"),
    ]

@app.get("/admin-list")
@jinja.hx("user-list.html", no_data=True)
def htmx_only() -> list[User]:
    return [User(first_name="Billy", last_name="Shears")]
```

### Custom templating

If you're not into Jinja templating, the `hx()` and `page()` decorators give you all the flexibility you need: you can integrate any HTML rendering or templating engine into `fasthx` simply by implementing the `HTMLRenderer` protocol. Similarly to the Jinja case, `hx()` only triggers HTML rendering for HTMX requests, while `page()` unconditionally renders HTML. See the example code below:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Any

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, Request
from fasthx import hx, page

# Create the app.
app = FastAPI()

# Create a dependecy to see that its return value is available in the render function.
def get_random_number() -> int:
    return 4  # Chosen by fair dice roll.

DependsRandomNumber = Annotated[int, Depends(get_random_number)]

# Create the render methods: they must always have these three arguments.
# If you're using static type checkers, the type hint of `result` must match
# the return type annotation of the route on which this render method is used.
def render_index(result: list[dict[str, str]], *, context: dict[str, Any], request: Request) -> str:
    return "<h1>Hello FastHX</h1>"

def render_user_list(result: list[dict[str, str]], *, context: dict[str, Any], request: Request) -> str:
    # The value of the `DependsRandomNumber` dependency is accessible with the same name as in the route.
    random_number = context["random_number"]
    lucky_number = f"<h1>{random_number}</h1>"
    users = "".join(("<ul>", *(f"<li>{u['name']}</li>" for u in result), "</ul>"))
    return f"{lucky_number}\n{users}"

@app.get("/")
@page(render_index)
def index() -> None:
    ...

@app.get("/htmx-or-data")
@hx(render_user_list)
def htmx_or_data(random_number: DependsRandomNumber) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    return [{"name": "Joe"}]

@app.get("/htmx-only")
@hx(render_user_list, no_data=True)
async def htmx_only(random_number: DependsRandomNumber) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    return [{"name": "Joe"}]
```

## Dependencies

The only dependency of this package is `fastapi`.

## Development

Use `ruff` for linting and formatting, `mypy` for static code analysis, and `pytest` for testing.

The documentation is built with `mkdocs-material` and `mkdocstrings`.

## Contributing

Feel free to ask questions or request new features.

And of course all contributions are welcome, including more documentation, examples, code, and tests.

The goal is to make `fasthx` a well-rounded project that makes even your most complex HTMX use-cases easy to implement.
