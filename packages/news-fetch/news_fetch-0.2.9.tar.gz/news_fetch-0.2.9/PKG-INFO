**news-fetch** is an open-source, easy-to-use news crawler that extracts structured information from almost any news website. It can recursively follow internal hyperlinks and read RSS feeds to fetch both recent and archived articles. You only need to provide the root URL of the news website to crawl it completely. News-fetch combines the power of multiple state-of-the-art libraries and tools, including [news-please](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please) by [Felix Hamborg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixhamborg/) and [Newspaper3K](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper/) by [Lucas (æ¬§é˜³è±¡) Ou-Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasouyang/). This package leverages features from both of these works.

I built this tool to minimize NaN or empty values when scraping data from various news websites. It's platform-independent and written in Python 3, making it easy for programmers and developers to access news data for their applications.

## Usage

To scrape all the news details, use the `newspaper` function:

```python
from newsfetch.news import Newspaper

news = Newspaper(url='https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aa-plays-a-pivotal-role-in-helping-people-escape-from-the-grip-of-alcoholism/article67716206.ece')
print(news.headline)
# Output: 'AA plays a pivotal role in helping people escape from the grip of alcoholism'
```

To extract URLs from a targeted website, call the `GoogleSearchNewsURLExtractor` by providing the keyword and newspaper link as arguments:

```python
from newsfetch.google import GoogleSearchNewsURLExtractor

google = GoogleSearchNewsURLExtractor(keyword='Alcoholics Anonymous', news_domain='https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/')
print(google.urls)
