### Example

Change  wallpaper  for  all monitors in hyprland/hyprpaper set-up:

```sh
pyprpaper -m $(hyprctl -j monitors | jq -r '.[].name' | tr '\n' ' ') -- /path/to/wallpaper/directories
```

### My Hyprpaper/Pyprpaper setup

I am  running hyprland/hyprpaper,  if you  are not
using hyprland things will defer depending on what
you are  using. However  `pyprpaper` will  work on
any wayland compositor if you are using hyprpaper.

You  can  have  an  empty  `hyprpaper.conf`  setup
and  just run  `pyprpaper` in  the `exec-once`  in
`hyprland.conf`.

My current `hyprpaper.conf` config:

```
splash = off
```

and in `hyprland.conf` I have:

```
exec-once = pyprpaper -t 600 -m $(hyprctl -j monitors | jq -r '.[].name' | tr '\n' ' ') -- /path/to/directory(ies)
```
