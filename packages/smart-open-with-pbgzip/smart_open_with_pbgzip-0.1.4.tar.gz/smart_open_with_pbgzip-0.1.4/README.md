[pbgzip](https://github.com/nh13/pbgzip) is used by some bioinformatics software, like [Pairtools](https://pairtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). However, as of 9/18/2024, pbgzip cannot read from files compressed with regular gzip, and it also does not offer a Python binding to make it simple to register with smart_open. This patch registers an alternative method of writing to .gz/.gzip files by piping the output to stdin of 'gzip' and piping its output to the output file. This makes it so that smart_open in write mode will output using pbgzip rather than gzip. Other than that, the behavior is identical. To restore the normal gzip-based output, call smart_open_with_pbgzip.setup_smart_open_with_gzip()
