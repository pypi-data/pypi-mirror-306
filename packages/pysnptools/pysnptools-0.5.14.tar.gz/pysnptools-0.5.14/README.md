PySnpTools
====================

PySnpTools is a library for reading and manipulating genetic data.

Main Features:

* [SnpReader](http://fastlmm.github.io/PySnpTools): Efficiently read genetic PLINK formats including \*.bed/bim/fam files.
          Also, efficiently read parts of files, read kernel data, and standardize data.
          New features include multi-threaded BED reading, cluster-ready BED data, on-the-fly SNP generation,
          and larger in-memory data.

* [DistReader](https://fastlmm.github.io/PySnpTools/#module-pysnptools.distreader): Efficiently work with
         unphased BGEN format and other diploid, biallelic distribution data.
          Also, efficiently read parts of files. See [Distribution IPython Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fastlmm/PySnpTools/blob/master/doc/ipynb/Dist.ipynb).

* [util](https://fastlmm.github.io/PySnpTools/#module-pysnptools.util): In one line, intersect and re-order IIDs from snpreader and other sources.
          Also, efficiently extract a submatrix from an ndarray.

* [IntRangeSet](https://fastlmm.github.io/PySnpTools/#util-intrangeset): Efficiently manipulate ranges of integers - for example, genetic position - with set operators including union, intersection, and set difference.

* [mapreduce1](https://fastlmm.github.io/PySnpTools/#module-pysnptools.util.mapreduce1): Run loops locally, on multiple processors, or on any cluster.

* [filecache](https://fastlmm.github.io/PySnpTools/#module-pysnptools.util.filecache):  Read and write files locally or from/to any remote storage.
