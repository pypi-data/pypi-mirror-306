# LN Matplotlib

The Livenodes Matplotlib package provides several plotting nodes (lines, heatmaps, bars, broken bars, etc).

[LiveNodes](https://livenodes.pages.csl.uni-bremen.de/livenodes/index.html) are small units of computation for digital signal processing in python. They are connected multiple synced channels to create complex graphs for real-time applications. Each node may provide a GUI or Graph for live interaction and visualization.

Any contribution is welcome! These projects take more time, than I can muster, so feel free to create issues for everything that you think might work better and feel free to create a MR for them as well!

Have fun and good coding!
