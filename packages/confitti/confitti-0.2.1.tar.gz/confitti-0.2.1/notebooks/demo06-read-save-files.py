# ## Read in results from prior notebooks
#
# We read the conic-section fits to proplyd arcs from YAML files, which we saved in the previous notebooks: demo03 and demo04. This requires that those notebooks must have been run first.

# ## Structure of a ConicFitResult object
#
# The objects that we read from the save files are `confitti.ConicFitResult` objects, which currently contain 3 properties. 
#
# The `.params` property is a dict that holds the best-fit parameters of the conic-section model. For instance, for first proplyd (from demo03):

arcfits[3].params

# The `.uparams` property is a dict that holds the 1-sigma uncertainties in the parameters of the conic-section model. For instance, for the second proplyd (from demo04):

arcfits[4].uparams

# Note that this looks different because I saved the results of the original LM fit, rather than the MCMC exploration (just to check that either will work). Hence, there is no `__lnsigma` parameter, which is the MCMC estimate in the scatter of the data points. Also, this is for the parabola fit, instead of the general conic section, so eccentricity is fixed at 1 and the uncertainty in eccentricity is zero. 
#
# The `.xy` property is a `confitti.XYconic` object that can be used for plotting the best-fit curve (see next section):

arcfits[3].xy


# Currently we do not include the originalÂ data points or any additional details of the fit, but these could be added if needed. 

# ## Plot multiple results on the same figure
#
# These proplyds come from different images and their pixel coordinate origins are completely different, so it doesn't really make any sense to plot them together. But we will pretend that it does, just to illustrate the mechanism. 
#
# First, we define a helper function to plot the +/- 1-sigma uncertainty cones so we can look for intersections.
