## Introduction
_GPX Analysis for rowing written in Python with a tkinter matplotlib interface_
#### Why?
I couldn't find the code for the old GPX analysis tool I wrote, so I'm taking the
opportunity to build a better/ more robust one.

## Prerequisites
#### Python Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Numpy ```pip install numpy```
- Matplotlib ```pip install matplotlib```
- appdirs ```pip install appdirs```
- Pillow (should already be installed with mpl) ```pip install pillow```

_Given it downloads map images from online it requires an internet connection to run._

## Installation
- It can also be installed with ```pip install gpx-analysis-edf1101``` and run from command line with ```python -m gpx_analysis``` 
## Getting Started & Notes
- For instructions on how to use please view the [Getting started page](Getting_started.md) on the project's GitHub

## Details
The project is hosted online at https://github.com/edf1101/GPX-Analysis
