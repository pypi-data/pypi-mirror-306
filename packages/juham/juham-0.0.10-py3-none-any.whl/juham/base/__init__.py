===========

Base classes for Juham - Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Masterpiece 

This package represents the most low level layer in the framework. 
Most notably, it defines  essential abstractions on which communcation 
between various IoT nodes and the data tracking is based on:

1. jmqtt - publish-subscriber model data transmission 

2. jdatabase - interface to time series database used for data recording

3. log - logging

Example:
::

    foo = Base("foo")
    foo.info("Hello world")
    foo.subscribe("any/topic")
    foo.publish("any/topic", any_msg)
    foo.write(any_measurement)
