⚠️ This package is actively being developed and accepting PRs (see TODO section)!

A Python wrapper for coingecko.com V3 api. Other notable api wrappers that didn't satisfy my need:
- [pycoingecko](https://github.com/man-c/pycoingecko) has not been active in over two years and does not support the newer endpoints

## Features
- 🪙 **CoinGecko** api routes, including current beta
- ✏️ **MyPy** Fully typed using most [recent versions](https://mypy-lang.org/)
- ⚒️ **Modern tooling** like [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- 📥 **GitHub Actions** CI/CD to automate everything
- ↩️ **Code Coverage** Fully tested using tools like [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)

## Installation
```sh
$ pip install python-coingecko
```

## Usage
Demo (free)
```
>>> from pycoingecko import CoinGecko
>>> coingecko = CoinGecko(api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>)
>>> coingecko.simple.coin_price_by_id(ids="bitcoin")
