# Azure Identity Broker plugin for Python

This package extends the [Azure Identity][azure_identity] library by providing supplemental credentials for authenticating via an authentication broker.

An authentication broker is an application that runs on a userâ€™s machine that manages the authentication handshakes and token maintenance for connected accounts. Currently, only the following brokers are supported:
- Web Account Manager (WAM) on Windows
- Company Portal on macOS

[Source code][source_code] | [Package (PyPI)][azure_identity_broker] | [API reference documentation][ref_docs] | [Microsoft Entra ID documentation][entra_id]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Identity Broker plugin for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-identity-broker
```

## Key concepts

This package enables broker support via `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` which is a subclass of the `InteractiveBrowserCredential` of the Azure Identity library.

### Parent window handles

When authenticating interactively via `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`, a parent window handle is required to ensure that the authentication dialog is shown correctly over the requesting window. In the context of graphical user interfaces on devices, a window handle is a unique identifier that the operating system assigns to each window. For the Windows operating system, this handle is an integer value that serves as a reference to a specific window.

## Microsoft account (MSA) passthrough

Microsoft accounts (MSA) are personal accounts created by users to access Microsoft services. MSA passthrough is a legacy configuration which enables users to get tokens to resources which normally don't accept MSA logins. This feature is only available to first-party applications. Users authenticating with an application that is configured to use MSA passthrough can set `enable_msa_passthrough` to `True` inside `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` to allow these personal accounts to be listed by broker.

## Redirect URIs

Microsoft Entra applications rely on redirect URIs to determine where to send the authentication response after a user has logged in. To enable brokered authentication through broker, a redirect URI matching the following pattern should be registered to the application:

* ``ms-appx-web://Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin/your_client_id``
if your app is expected to run on Windows 10+
* ``msauth.com.msauth.unsignedapp://auth``
if your app is expected to run on Mac

## Examples

### Authenticate with `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`

This example demonstrates using `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` as a broker-enabled credential for authenticating with the `BlobServiceClient` from the [azure-storage-blob][azure_storage_blob] library. Here, the `win32gui` module from the `pywin32` package is used to get the current window.

```python
import win32gui
from azure.identity.broker import InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Get the handle of the current window
current_window_handle = win32gui.GetForegroundWindow()

credential = InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential(parent_window_handle=current_window_handle)
client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=credential)
```

To bypass the account selection dialog and use the default broker account, set the `use_default_broker_account` argument to `True`. The credential will attempt to silently use the default broker account. If using the default account fails, the credential will fall back to interactive authentication.

```python
credential = InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential(
    parent_window_handle=current_window_handle,
    use_default_broker_account=True
)
```

## Troubleshooting

See the Azure Identity [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting_guide] for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

## Next steps

### Client library support

Client and management libraries listed on the [Azure SDK release page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/python.html) that support Microsoft Entra authentication accept credentials from this library. You can learn more about using these libraries in their documentation, which is linked from the release page.

### Known issues

This library doesn't support [Azure AD B2C][b2c].

For other open issues, refer to the library's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAzure.Identity).

# Release History

## 1.3.0b1 (2024-11-05)

### Features Added

- Added broker on macOS support.

## 1.2.0 (2024-10-08)

### Other Changes

- Stable release for the Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token support to `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`.

## 1.2.0b1 (2024-09-20)

### Features Added

- `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` now implements the `SupportsTokenInfo` protocol. It now has a `get_token_info` method which returns an `AccessTokenInfo` object. The `get_token_info` method is an alternative method to `get_token` that improves support for more complex authentication scenarios.
- Added Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token support to `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`.

## 1.1.0 (2024-04-09)

### Features Added

- `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential` now supports a `use_default_broker_account` property to enable the use of the currently logged in operating system account for authentication rather than prompting for a credential.
- Added `enable_support_logging` as a keyword argument to `InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`. This allows additional support logging which may contain PII.

### Other Changes

- Python 3.7 is no longer supported. Please use Python version 3.8 or later.
- Bumped minimum dependency on `azure-identity` to `1.15.0`.

## 1.0.0 (2023-11-07)

### Features Added

- `enable_broker` is always on if running on Windows. Automatically fall back into non-broker mode if running on MacOS or Linux.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `UsernamePasswordBrokerCredential`

## 1.0.0b1 (2023-10-12)

### Features Added

- Added `azure.identity.broker.InteractiveBrowserBrokerCredential`
  and `azure.identity.broker.UsernamePasswordBrokerCredential` which have broker support.
