"""
AssetClass represents the different types of financial assets.

This type is defined as a Literal with the following possible values:
    - "us_equity": Represents U.S. equity securities (stocks).
    - "us_option": Represents U.S. options contracts.
    - "us_futures": Represents U.S. futures contracts.
    - "crypto": Represents cryptocurrency assets.
    - "forex": Represents foreign exchange (currency) assets.
    - "cfd": Represents an asset typically traded on metatrader or similar.

Usage:
    def process_asset(asset_type: AssetClass):
        if asset_type == "us_equity":
            # Handle U.S. equity
        elif asset_type == "crypto":
            # Handle cryptocurrency
        # ... and so on

Note:
    This type uses the Literal type from the typing module, which requires
    Python 3.8 or later. For earlier versions, consider using Union[str] and
    validating the input manually.

    - cls: Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit "market on close" (MOC) and "limit on close" (LOC) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market closing auction. Any unfilled orders after the close will be cancelled.
    - ioc: An Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) order requires all or part of the order to be executed immediately. Any unfilled portion of the order is canceled.
    - fok: A Fill or Kill (FOK) order is only executed if the entire order quantity can be filled, otherwise the order is canceled.
