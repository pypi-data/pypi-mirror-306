# FastWand

A CLI tool to initialize FastHTML + Tailwind + DaisyUI projects. FastWand automatically downloads and installs the Tailwind CSS CLI bundled with DaisyUI for your operating system and architecture.

⚠️ **ALPHA STATUS**: This project is in early development. Expect bugs and breaking changes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher

## Installation

    pip install fastwand

## Usage

### Initialize a New Project

    fastwand init [DIRECTORY]

This will:
1. Download the appropriate Tailwind CLI and DaisyUI plugin for your system
2. Create a basic FastHTML project structure
3. Set up Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI

### Development Mode
Run these commands in separate terminal windows:

    # Terminal 1: Watch for CSS changes
    fastwand watch
