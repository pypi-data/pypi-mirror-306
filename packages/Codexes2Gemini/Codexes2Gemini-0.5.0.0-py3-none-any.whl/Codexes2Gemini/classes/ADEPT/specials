AI-9	"While the pace of innovation and investment in the U.S. is at an all-time high, participants cautioned that this will not be sustained without strategic direction, robust adoption of commercial space capabilities expressed in meaningful contract opportunities, strategic workforce development, attention to fragile domestic supply lines, and addressing the anemic funding to prototype, validate and accelerate the adoption of innovative and disruptive space capabilities for national security."
AI-10	"A robust/competitive U.S. Space Industrial Base is essential to maintaining the U.S. as a preeminent space power, but its competitive advantage is threatened by increasing globalization of space industrial capabilities. Other nations are aggressively expanding their space industrial bases. To meet these challenges, the USSF must lead and develop an all-of-government strategy to partner with the U.S. Space Industrial Base, taking advantage of present, commercial capabilities while stimulating future commercial capability development for U.S. space military needs."

If this competition is won by China, they will leverage the substantial soft power it would gain from Lunar preeminence to achieve a wide variety of national security, economic, and diplomatic/political objectives. The global perception of the United States will be substantially wounded, feeding a narrative of American decline and China‚Äôs ascendance. China conducting these activities in partnership with Russia would have even graver implications for national security."

They synchronize, coordinate and secure our financial transactions. They connect our cities and rural areas, providing long-distance communications for television, radio, telephony and broadband internet. They supply weather, traffic and logistics data to enable city planning, agriculture, public health and transportation.

The notable exception here is NASA, which continues to strengthen both its direct investment in, and procurement of, commercial space offerings. According to participants, a lack of strategic guidance and clarity; the inability to reward private capital investment with meaningful contracts -- to 'buy commercial;' a fragile supply chain; and strong international competition and predatory practices by adversaries means that failure to take action puts the gains so far at risk."

AI-105	"A long-term, national space strategy integrating civil, commercial and national security space lines of effort must be developed to retain the U.S.‚Äô dominant and leadership position in the emerging future of space. This strategy must account for the possible space futures developed in the workshop."
AI-106	"The 2060 space world will be highly complex and diverse as to the number of state and non-state actors, their capabilities, and their interests. Commercial space presents unique issues as to ownership and sovereignty that, if not resolved, could lead to commercial space entities as independent or semi-independent space powers, resulting in significant opportunities and challenges to U.S. space power. Space power will be widely distributed, making it impossible for any one nation or entity to have predominant space power in the civil, commercial, and military domains. The diversity and distribution of space power enables a wide range of alliances, partnerships, and shared interest. These relationships will be diverse and vary with time as the interest and capabilities of space faring entities develop and change. This complexity poses

AI-109	"Most companies: Cited unpredictable U.S. Government demand as the greatest hurdle to growth. Cited export controls and ITAR-restrictions in their top-4 hurdles to growth."
AI-110	This indicates that the Space Industrial Base (SIB) is predominantly small, early stage businesses aligned with demand signals from the government and private industry. Most have tremendous potential for growth in a globally competitive new space market.
AI-111	"The uncertainty of the global pandemic weighed down many companies in early 2020. Venture capital and the public markets have responded positively by investing more dollars into commercial space companies over the past year than in any year prior. It is worth noting, however, that a majority of today‚Äôs most successful commercial space startups have government business in the form of prototype, procurement and service contracts. Investors took note of this fact and observed that the non-dilutive government money did not 'dry up.'"
AI-112	"However, respondents noted the difficulty of actually applying and getting a SBIR to be high, with many calling the process 'difficult', 'confusing', and 'not user-friendly.' Companies noted a 'valley of death' beyond Phase 2, due to the difficulty in connecting their technology to a program of record, stalling their traction with the DOD."
AI-113	"A quarter (26%) of respondents are considering SPACs as a viable exit strategy for their companies. All of these respondents are non-traditional vendors. The primary cited reason for considering a SPAC is immediate access to capital, along with freedom from recurring fundraising activities."
AI-114	"The shock is unlikely to resolve quickly. Supply uncertainty will beget artificial demand spikes as companies seek to build inventory to buffer against future shortages, like shoppers buying more toilet-paper than usual at the sight of empty shelves. Adding capacity takes years and, while necessary, won't come in time to address the current state. Some project significant shortages are likely through the beginning of 2023."
AI-115	"The government‚Äôs demand signal was deemed as by 42 of the 57 survey respondents (~74%) which was seen as a hurdle to future growth. SpeciÔøΩc challenges included access to key points of contact in government agencies and/or the responsiveness of those POCs, as well as the need for a security clearance and/or an existing contract in order to conduct substantial business development activities. Others felt the government needed to make more long-term commitments to support long-term fundraising and investment. Additionally, many vendors expressed that the contracting process remains lengthy and cumbersome. Some recommended leveraging fully-negotiable Other Transaction Agreements, such as DIU‚Äôs Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO), to get vendors under contract more rapidly and ÔøΩexibly (i.e.

AI-118	"To remain relevant in the rapidly transforming space industry, the government must move away from its traditional acquisition approach and adopt a more venture-like attitude toward investment and acquisition. This transition could entail suffering some outright failures to achieve one spectacular home run."
AI-119	"The Hybrid Space Architecture is the integration of emergent 'new space' smallsat capabilities with traditional U.S. Government space systems. This evolving resilient architecture will use a 'variable trust' network framework for rapid and secure data exchange among proliferated satellite systems and services that are large and small; government and commercial; U.S. and Allied; in various, diverse, and layered orbits. The architecture shifts from a platform-centric to an information-centric paradigm."
