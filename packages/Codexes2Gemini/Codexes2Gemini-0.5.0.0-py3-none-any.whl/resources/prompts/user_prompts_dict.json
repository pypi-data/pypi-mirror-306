Example from a full-length book about the varieties of authorial intention:\n\nAnalytic Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction: The Origins of an Intellectual Taboo\n\nPolarization of the classic debate around the “intentional fallacy” and the historical background for the popularity of the textualist view. Its connection with avant-garde twentieth-century artistic practices, its appeal to religious and radical critics who seek a source of meaning for literature that transcends the author, and its connection with psychoanalysis. Difficulty of maintaining the textualist attitude in practice. Its distorting effects. The editor’s dilemma without recourse to intention.\n\nChapter 1: Actions, Intentions, Authors, Works\n\nActions and intentions\nExplanation of the basic notions of action and intention as deployed in everyday life. The belief-desire-action triad. Intentional actions not necessarily the result of conscious deliberation.\n\nIs intentional psychology legitimate?\nAbsence of a serious candidate for replacing intention in explaining individual or even institutional behavior. The “Theory of Mind” hypothesis as one explanation of our power to discern intentions.\n\nIntention and language\nThe chosenness of words in a particular context makes them worth interpreting for the audience. Example of Borges’s story “The Library of\nBabel.” The importance of authorial intention does not mean that evidence from outside the text should necessarily play an important role in literary interpretation.\n\n{End of Example}\n\nThe tone of your writing should match the tone of the book.

You do not need to mention the CMS as you create the list.\n\n1.44 Not every work that includes abbreviations needs a separate list of abbreviations with the terms or names they stand for. If many are used, or if a few are used frequently, a list is useful (see fig. 1.8); its location should always be given in the table of contents. If abbreviations are used in the text or footnotes, the list may appear in the front matter. If they are used only in the back matter, the list should appear before the first element in which abbreviations are used, whether the appendixes, the endnotes, or the bibliography. A list of abbreviations is generally not a substitute for using the full form of a term at its first occurrence in the text (see 10.3). In the list, alphabetize terms by the abbreviation, not by the spelled-out form. See also 14.60.\n14.60: Where many abbreviations of titles, manuscript collections, personal names, or other entities are used in a work—say, ten or more—they are best listed alphabetically in a separate section. In a book, the list may appear in the front matter (if footnotes are used) or in the end matter preceding the endnotes (if these are used). It is usually headed “Abbreviations” and should be included in the table of contents (see 1.4, 1.44). Where only a few abbreviations are used, these are occasionally listed as the first section of the endnotes (see fig. 14.7) or at the head of the bibliography. Titles that are italicized in the notes or bibliography should be italicized in their abbreviated form in the list of abbreviations and elsewhere.\n\nOutput begins: # Abbreviations\n\n",
