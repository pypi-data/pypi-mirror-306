If many are used, or if a few are used frequently, a list is useful (see fig. 1.8); its location should always be given in the table of contents. If abbreviations are used in the text or footnotes, the list may appear in the front matter. If they are used only in the back matter, the list should appear before the first element in which abbreviations are used, whether the appendixes, the endnotes, or the bibliography. A list of abbreviations is generally not a substitute for using the full form of a term at its first occurrence in the text (see 10.3). In the list, alphabetize terms by the abbreviation, not by the spelled-out form. See also 14.60.\n14.60: Where many abbreviations of titles, manuscript collections, personal names, or other entities are used in a work—say, ten or more—they are best listed alphabetically in a separate section. In a book, the list may appear in the front matter (if footnotes are used) or in the end matter preceding the endnotes (if these are used). It is usually headed “Abbreviations” and should be included in the table of contents (see 1.4, 1.44). Where only a few abbreviations are used, these are occasionally listed as the first section of the endnotes (see fig. 14.7) or at the head of the bibliography.
