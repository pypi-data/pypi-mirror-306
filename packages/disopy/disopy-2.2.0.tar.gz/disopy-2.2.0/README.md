</div>

## Setup
The only external dependencies needed are:
- `ffmpeg`.
- `libopus`.

Then just install the bot from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):
```sh
pipx install disopy
```

Or directy with `pip`:
```sh
python3 -m pip install disopy
```

Finally generate a basic config file:
```sh
disopy --generate-config
```

It will be located at `${XDG_CONFIG_DIR}/disopy/config.toml` (in most cases `$HOME/.config/disopy/config.toml`), remember to edit it with your configuration values.

### Docker
There is an official Docker container with name [`ghcr.io/kutu-dev/disopy`](https://github.com/kutu-dev/disopy/pkgs/container/disopy). An [example compose file](./compose.yaml) is also provided.

## Running the bot
The bot needs two environment variables:
- `DISOPY_SUBSONIC_PASSWORD`: The password to be send to the Subsonic REST API.
- `DISOPY_DISCORD_TOKEN`: The token to be used when authenticating to the Discord API.

And then just start the bot!
```sh
DISOPY_SUBSONIC_PASSWORD=foo DISOPY_DISCORD_TOKEN=bar disopy
```

> [!WARNING]  
> This bot needs the `Message Content Intent` privileged Gateway enable in the [Discord Developers Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Bot settings to run correctly.
