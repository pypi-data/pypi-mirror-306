Discovered how Hatch (Python's recommended build backend) determines which files to include: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#default-file-selection. For my purposes, the relevant idea is that it'll include all files in the src/<Name>/__init__.py folder, but the __init__.py file must be present.

These can be overriden using the [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] table.
