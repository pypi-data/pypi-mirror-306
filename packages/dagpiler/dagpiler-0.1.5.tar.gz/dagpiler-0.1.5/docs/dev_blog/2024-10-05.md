Today I've been testing what I've written so far, which is reading in the files and constructing the DAG for one package. I am now trying to incorporate a second package, which led me a question about how to specify a *local* dependency in pyproject.toml.

Here is the relevant documentation: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#direct-references and https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/metadata/#allowing-direct-references

The syntax for adding a package from disk is:
```toml
[tool.hatch.metadata]
allow-direct-references = true

[project]
dependencies = [
    "package_name @ file:///path/to/folder/containing/dependency"
]
```
