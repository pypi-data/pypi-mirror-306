Description: # Finished Booting Skill
        
        ## Summary
        
        The Finished Booting skill provides a notification when OpenVoiceOS (OVOS) has fully started and all core services are ready. This notification can be spoken to the user or simply logged, depending on the user's preferences.
        
        ## Description
        
        This skill ensures that users are informed when OVOS has completed booting and all essential services (such as network, GUI, and others) are ready for use. It provides a customizable ready notification that can be enabled or disabled via voice commands. The notification can be delivered either via a spoken message, sound, or visual cues on connected devices.
