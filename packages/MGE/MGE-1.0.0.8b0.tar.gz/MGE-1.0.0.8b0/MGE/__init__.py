"""
LibMGE is an open-source library created for the development of 2D programs and games in Python.
Our goal is to provide a simple and accessible solution, allowing developers,
from beginners to professionals, to rely on an efficient tool for creating
games and graphical interfaces.

Whether for prototyping or full game development, LibMGE was designed to make the process more
intuitive and faster without compromising quality.
