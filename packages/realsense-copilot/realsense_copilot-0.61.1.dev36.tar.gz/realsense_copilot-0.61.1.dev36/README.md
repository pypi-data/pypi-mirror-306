# RealSense Copilot is AI pair programming tool for Intel RealSense cameras in your terminal.

RealSense Copilot (based on Aider) lets you pair program with LLMs,
to write and edit code in your local git repository.
Start a new project or work with an existing git repo.
Realsense works best with GPT-4o & Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can
[connect to almost any LLM](https://aider.chat/docs/llms.html).

## Getting started

You can get started quickly like this:

```
$ python -m pip install -U realsense-copilot

# Change directory into a git repo
cd /to/your/git/repo

# Work with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on your repo
$ export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-goes-here
$ realsense demo.py

# Work with GPT-4o on your repo
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-goes-here
