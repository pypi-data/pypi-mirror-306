# AURIS

**A**udio **U**nderstanding for **R**esource-constrained **I**ntelligent **S**ystems

## Overview

AURIS is an open-source framework for efficient audio understanding on resource-constrained devices. The project aims to enable real-time audio processing and analysis on microcontrollers and other edge devices using optimized neural networks.

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development. Features, API, and documentation will be added progressively.

## Goals

- Lightweight audio understanding framework for embedded systems
- Optimized for minimal resource usage (RAM, CPU, power)
- Support for common microcontrollers and edge devices
- Easy integration into existing embedded projects

## Current Status

Currently in internal development phase. Public release timeline will be announced when the core functionality is stabilized.
