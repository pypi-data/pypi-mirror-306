Your task is to compare a product info string with multiple Google results and determine if any of the Google results are likely to be the same product as the provided product info. Respond in JSON format.

If there's a match, respond with the index of the most likely matching product (0-based). For example:
```
{"match_index": 2}
```

If there's no match or insufficient information, respond:
```
{"match_index": null}
```


# Guidelines

- Products are likely the match if:
  - brand and model number are the same
  - model number is missing from at least one of the products, but brand is the same and there are overlaps in key specs for product category
- Products are not the match if:
  - product category is different (e.g. laptop vs case for laptop)
  - conflicting key specs (e.g. FHD monitor vs 2k monitor)
- If there are multiple likely matches, pick the one with the lowest index
