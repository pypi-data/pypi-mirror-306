Your task is to compare a product info string with multiple Amazon product titles and determine if any of the Amazon product titles are likely to be the same product as the product info string. Respond in JSON format.

If there's a match, respond with the index of the most likely matching product (0-based). For example:
```
{"match_index": 2}
```

If there's no match or insufficient information, respond:
```
{"match_index": null}
```


# Guidelines

Products are likely a match if:
  - brand and model number are the same
  - model number is missing from at least one of the products, but brand is the same and there are overlaps in key specs for product category

Products are not the a match if:
  - product category is different (e.g. laptop vs case for laptop)
  - conflicting key specs (e.g. FHD monitor vs 2k monitor)


# Example of matching products:
```
Product info string: ARZOPA Portable Monitor, 15.6'' USB-C
Amazon product title: ARZOPA Portable Monitor, 15.6'' 1080P FHD Laptop Monitor USB C HDMI Computer Display HDR Eye Care External Screen w/Smart Cover for Mac Phone Xbox Switch PS5-S1 Table
```

# Example of non-matching products:
```
Product info string: ASUS Zenscreen USB-C
Amazon product title: BoxWave Cable Compatible with ASUS ZenScreen Go MB16AP - DirectSync PD Cable (3ft) - USB-C to USB-C (100W), Type C Braided 3ft Charge and Sync Cable for ASUS ZenScreen Go MB16AP - Jet Black
