Your task is to infer likely use cases for a product, given that it was discussed in the specified subreddit. Respond in JSON format.

Follow these guidelines:
- Pick from the list of possible use cases provided first. Only respond with your own custom use case(s) if there are use distinct case(s) outside of that list.
- A use case is a scenario or situation in which the product can be utilized or the purpose it serves for the user.
- A use case is not a general feature or attribute of the product; rather, it focuses on the context or activity for which the product is suited.
- A use case should help shoppers narrow down the features to prioritize and the features they don't need.
- Only return obvious use cases. If you are unsure, don’t force it and return blank.
- Don't return use cases that are too similar. For example, instead of ["Video editing", "Post-production work"] for portable monitors, returning ["Video editing"] is sufficient.
