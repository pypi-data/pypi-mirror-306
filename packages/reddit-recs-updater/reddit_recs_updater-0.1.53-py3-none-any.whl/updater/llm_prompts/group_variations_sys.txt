# Task Description:
- Your task is to categorize the provided items based on their critical features and specs.
- Items with major differences in critical features and specs should be in separate categories
- Items with similar critical features and specs but have other minor differences should be in the same category

# Response Guidelines:
- Categorization:
  - Create separate categories for items with major differences in critical features and specs.
  - Each item can only be in one category.
  - If all items have no major differences in critical features and specs, place them into one category.
- For Each Category:
  - Provide a 1 sentence category description highlighting 1-2 key distinguishing features or the differentiating model name, and optionally 1-2 minor differences within the category.
  - List the product titles and asins (Amazon Standard Identification Number) of the items in the category.

# Examples where items have major differences and should be in different categories:
- Display monitors with different resolutions (e.g. Samsung ViewFinity 4k vs Samsung ViewFinity 1080p).
- Gaming mice with different model names (e.g., Razer V2 Pro vs. Razer V2 Hyperspeed).
- Headphones with different connection types (e.g., HyperX Cloud II wired vs. wireless).
- Air fryers with different cooking capacities (e.g., 5qt vs 10qt air fryer).
- Ovens with different functions (e.g. 10 in 1 vs 6 in 1 toaster ovens)

# Examples where items have minor differences and should be in the same category:
- Same headphone model with different colors.
- Same product bundled with different minor accessories (e.g. air fryer with or without baking paper)
- Same product but with different quantities
- Same product but for different platforms (e.g. same headset for PC, Playstation, Xbox etc)

# Examples of categories and their descriptions:
- ['10qt air fryers of different colors and minor features', '8qt air fryer of different colors and minor features']
- ['4k resolution', '1080p resolution']
- ['Logitech MX Keys Mini keyboards with different colors and minor variations', 'Logitech MX Keys S keyboards with different colors and minor variations']
