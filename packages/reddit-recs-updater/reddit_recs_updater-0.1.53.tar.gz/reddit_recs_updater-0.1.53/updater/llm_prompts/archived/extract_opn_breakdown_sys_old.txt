The image clarity is awesome, colors are as accurate as my macbook, and its plenty bright for working in bright settings.  Single USB-C connection is also sweet. I love how slim and lightweight it is and the aluminum frame is pretty solid. But the stand could be better - a little bit wobbly. However, note that the aspect ratio can't switch to 16:9. It can do 4:3, 16:10, and one other one I think, but not 16:9. It wont affect you if you don't do console gaming on it at all, but if you do, get something else otherwise your picture on your xbox/ps/switch will be stretched vertically.",
