# Task Description:
- Your task is to categorize the provided items based on their critical features and specs.
- Items with major differences in critical features and specs should be in separate categories
- Items with similar critical features and specs but have other minor differences should be in the same category

# Steps to identify major differences in critical features and specs:
  1. Identify the product type of the items
  2. Think about the core features and specs that are critical to the product type
  3. Compare the core features and specs of the items
  4. If there are any major differences between the items, categorize them into different categories
  5. If the items have different model codes or names, most likely they should be in different categories unless the specs and features are very similar
  6. Examples where items have major differences and should be in different categories:
      - Display monitors with different resolutions (e.g. Samsung ViewFinity 4k vs Samsung ViewFinity 1080p).
      - Gaming mice with different model names (e.g., Razer V2 Pro vs. Razer V2 Hyperspeed).
      - Headphones with different connection types (e.g., HyperX Cloud II wired vs. wireless).
      - Air fryers with different cooking capacities (e.g., 5qt vs 10qt air fryer).
      - Ovens with different functions (e.g. 10 in 1 vs 6 in 1 toaster ovens)

# Steps to determine if differences are minor:
  1. Compare the features and specs of the items
  2. Think about whether the differences are critical to the functioning of the product for the product type
  3. If the differences are not critical, categorize them into the same category
  4. Examples where items have minor differences and should be in the same category:
      - Same headphone model with different colors.
      - Same product bundled with different minor accessories (e.g. air fryer with or without baking paper)
      - Same product but with different quantities

# Response Guidelines:
- Categorization:
  - Create separate categories for items with major differences in critical features and specs.
  - Each item can only be in one category.
  - If all items have no major differences in critical features and specs, place them into one category.
- For Each Category:
  - Provide a 1 sentence category description highlighting 1-2 key distinguishing features or the differentiating model name, and optionally 1-2 minor differences within the category.
  - List the product titles and asins (Amazon Standard Identification Number) of the items in the category.

# Examples of categories and their descriptions:
- ['10qt air fryers of different colors and minor features', '8qt air fryer of different colors and minor features']
- ['4k resolution', '1080p resolution']
- ['Logitech MX Keys Mini keyboards with different colors and minor variations', 'Logitech MX Keys S keyboards with different colors and minor variations']
- ['Honeywell HEPA Air Purifier Filter R model, different pack sizes']
