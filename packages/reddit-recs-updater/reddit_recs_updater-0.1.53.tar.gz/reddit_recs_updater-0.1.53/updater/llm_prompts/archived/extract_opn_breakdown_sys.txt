      "body": "I recently got the ASUS ZenScreen 15.6" portable monitor, and I've been using it for work and light gaming. The image clarity is awesome, colors are as accurate as my macbook, and its plenty bright for working in bright settings.  Single USB-C connection is also sweet. I love how slim and lightweight it is and the aluminum frame is pretty solid. But the stand could be better - a little bit wobbly. However, note that the aspect ratio can't switch to 16:9. It can do 4:3, 16:10, and one other one I think, but not 16:9. It wont affect you if you don't do console gaming on it at all, but if you do, get something else otherwise your picture on your xbox/ps/switch will be stretched vertically.",
