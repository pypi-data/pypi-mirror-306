## Context

A user shopping for a product said that he is looking for a "{pd_category}".Â 

When he searched Reddit for recommendations, these are the search results:
<search_results>
{search_results}
</search_results>

## Your task

Are most of results relevant? Respond with true or false.

If most of the results are not relevant, help the user search better for recommendations in the form of "best {product_category}" and "{product_category} recommendations". Respond what {product_category} should be.

## Guidelines in coming up the product category:
- Optimize for getting a good number of results. Don't be too specific in the product category (e.g. 15 inch TVs) because that will yield too little results
- But at the same time, don't be too broad (e.g. kitchen appliances) because that will yield results that are not specific enough to be helpful

### Example product categories
- "15inch TVs" should be "Small Tvs"

## Response format:
Respond in the following json format based on these examples:

<example>
{
  "search_results_mostly_relevant": true
  "product_category": null
}
</example>

<example>
{
  "search_results_mostly_relevant": false
  "product_category": "Small TVs"
}
