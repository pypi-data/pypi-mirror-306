# `squares`

`squares` is a Python-based command-line application that finds the two closest square numbers to a given input number.

## Installation

To install `squares`, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install squares-cli
```

This will install the `squares` command, allowing you to find the closest square numbers directly from the command line.

## Usage

The `squares` command can find the two closest square numbers (one above and one below) to a given input number. You can use it in various ways, specifying options to control the output.

### Basic Command

```bash
squares [OPTIONS] <number>
```

If no options are specified, `squares` will output both the closest square number below and the closest square number above the given input, separated by a comma.

### Options

- `--below` - Outputs only the closest square below the input number.
- `--above` - Outputs only the closest square above the input number.
- `--both`  - Outputs both the closest squares (this is the default behavior if no option is specified).
- `-h` or `--help` - Displays the help message.

### Examples

Here are some example commands and their expected outputs:

#### Default (Both Closest Squares)

```bash
squares 12
```

**Output:**
```
9, 16
```

In this example, `squares 12` finds the closest squares around 12, returning both the closest square below (9) and the closest square above (16).

#### Closest Square Below

```bash
squares --below 12
```

**Output:**
```
9
```

This example uses `--below` to return only the closest square below 12, which is 9.

#### Closest Square Above

```bash
squares --above 12
```

**Output:**
```
16
```

Here, `--above` is used to return only the closest square above 12, which is 16.

#### Explicitly Returning Both (Same as Default)

```bash
squares --both 12
```

**Output:**
```
9, 16
```

Using `--both` explicitly returns both closest squares around 12. This produces the same result as the default behavior.

### Man Page

A man page is also included in the installation. You can access it by typing:

```bash
man squares
```

This will display comprehensive information about the command, options, and examples, similar to what is provided in this README.

## Additional Notes

- **Operating System Compatibility**: `squares` is compatible with UNIX-like systems (Linux and macOS) and Windows, though the man page installation may vary depending on the OS.
- **Python Version**: This package requires Python 3.6 or higher.[
