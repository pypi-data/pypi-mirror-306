### Basic Usage

### Retrieving Logs

```python
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from model_logger.models import ModelLog

# Get all logs for a specific article
article = Article.objects.get(id=1)
logs = ModelLog.objects.filter(
    content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Article),
    object_id=article.id
)

# Get all logs across all models
all_logs = ModelLog.objects.all()
```

### ModelLog Fields

The `ModelLog` model includes the following fields:

- `name`: The name of the logged action
- `description`: Detailed description of the action

- `content_type`: The model type being logged

    @log_action(
        name="Article Published",
        description="Article was published to the main page"
